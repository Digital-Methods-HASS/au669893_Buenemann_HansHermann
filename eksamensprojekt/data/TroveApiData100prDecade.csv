199395527,GERMAN PRECEPT AND GERMAN PRACTICE.,"  GERMAN  PRECEPT  AND  GERMAN  PRACTICE.   The  ""Contemporary  Review""  for  July  publishes  a  translation  of  a  pamphlet  Herr  Meyer,  a  well  known  writer,  it  ap  pears,  on  naval  subjects,  which  has  had  it  great  circulation  in  Germany,  and  bubbles  over  with  hatred  to  England,  while  claim-   ing  for  its  writer  an  ample  participation  in  that  ""inextinguishable  enthusiasm  for  the  Good,  the  Beautiful  and  the  True,""  by  which  it  is  the  peculiar  privilege  of  his  countrymen  to  be  animated.  His  animosity  to  the  mother  country,  its  people  and  its  institutions  is  so  intense  that  he  goes  out  into  the  street  and  ""swears  at  large""  in  order  to  ease  his  mind.  As  to  her  land  forces,  heinforms  us  that  ""a  couple  of  French  army  corps  would  suffice  to  drive  the  wonderful  army  of  England,  with  all  her  Indian  and  colonial  troops,  to  the  devil.""  Whatever  reputation  it  may  have  wrongfully  acquired  in  former  days  has  van-  ished,  he  tells  us.  ""English  incendiarism  in  South  Africa  has  tarnished  the  Iast  re-  mains  of  England's  military  glory,  and  branded  her  name  as  infamous  for  all  time.  It  has  revealed  to  the  world  the  shameless-  ness  of  the  English  character  and  an  un-  ""scrupulousness  which  hesitates  at  nothing.""  Words  almost  fail  Herr  Meyer,  indeed,  when  he  endeavors  to  express  his  contempt  for  the  British  fleet,  and  his  enormous  ad-  miration  for  that  of  Germany;  while  to  those  who  are  capable  of  holding  up  the  former  as  a  model  for  the  construction  of  the  latter,  he  sarcastically  exclaims,  ""Eng-  land,  powerful  at  sea,  and  therefore  on  land  —  the  land  grabber  and  therefore  the  in-  satiable;  England,  unscrupulous  in  her  am-  bition,  and  therefore  breaking  up  in  an  ir-  reparable  decay;  England  is  to  be  the  edu-  cator  of  Germany!  Only  he  who  is  taken  in  by  the  deceptions  conjured  up  by  the  Protean  arts  and  duplicity  of  Britain  can  allow  her  to  be  capable  of  such  a  task.""  Finally,  having  exhausted  his  tolerably  copious  vocabulary  of  vituperation  in  ve-  hement  abuse  of  our  countrymen,  Herr  Meyer  winds  up  his  pamphlet  in  these  stir-  ring  words:  —  ""Unite,  German  people,  in  the  war  cry  of  Germany,  'Los  von  Eng-  land!'""  —  which  may  be  read  as  a  para-  phrase  of  the  elder  Cato's  memorable  words,  ""Delenda  est  Carthage.""  Having  listened  to  Herr  Meyer's  Anglo-  phobic  declamation  against  the  ""infamous""  conduct  of  Great  Britain  in  the  Boer  cam-  paign,  based,  as  a  matter  of  course,  upon  the  monstrous  fabrications  invented  by  Dr.  Leyds,  and  circulated  through  the  medium  of  the  reptile  press  in  Germany  and  else-  where,  it  is  amusing  to  turn  to  the  very  next  article  in  the  same  number  of  the  ""Contemporary,""  and  to  read  Mr.  Auberon  Herbert's  narrative,  mainly  drawn  from  German  sources,  of  the  atrocities  perpe-  trated  by  the  Germans  during  their  occu-  pation  of  France  in  1870-71.  ""All  movable  property  was  subject  to  demands  of  German  commanders  to  be  transferred  by  the  horses  and  labor  of  the  inhabitants  to  any  point  directed.  The  penalty  for  imperfect  com-  pliance  was  fine.  To  ensure  payment  of  the  fine  there  was  seizure  of  the  chief  inhabi-  tants  as  hostages.  If  the  village  or  town  de-  fended  its  property  the  penalty  was  burn-  ing  of  the  village.  If  any  German  troops  al-  lowed  themselves  to  be  surprised  in  any  vil-  lage,  penalty—  burning  of  the  village.  For  injury  to  roads,  bridges,  railways  —  penalty,  devastation  of  the  district.  For  wearing  a  not  recognised  uniform  —  penalty,  death.""  The  French  freeshooters  and  the  followers  of  Garibaldi  after  their  capture  by  the  Ger-  mans  were  shot  down  like  dogs.  ""Every  vil-  lage  in  which  an  act  of  treachery  has  been  committed,""  said  Bismarck,  ""should  be  burnt  to  the  ground,  and  all  the  male  in-  habitants  hanged"";  and  when  he  heard  of  the  capture  of  1200  prisoners,  many  of  whom  were  freeshooters,  he  angrily  exclaimed,  ""Prisoners!

It  has  revealed  to  the  world  the  shamelessncss  of  the  English  character  and  on  unscrupulousness  which  hesitates  at  nothing.""  Words  almost  fail  Herr  Meyer,  indeed,  when  he  endeavours  to  express  his  contempt  for  tho  British  fleet,  and  his  enormous  admiration  for  that  of  Germany  ;  while  to  those  who  are  capable  of  holding  up  tbe  former  as   a  model  for  tho  construction  of  tho  latter,  he  sarcastically  exclaims,  ""  Eng  land,  powerful  at  sea,  and  therefore  on  land  —  tho  land  grabber  and  tberoforo  tho  insatiahlo  ;  England,  unscrupulous  in  her  nrabitiou,  and  therefore  breaking  up  in  an  irreparable  decay  ;  England  is  to  be  tho  educator  ol  Gormnuy.

100489928,German Militarism.,"  German  Militarism.   Most  extraordinary  evidence  was  given  at  the  trial  by  court  martial  at  Readsbur^  of  Sergeant  Franzky,  which  ended  in  the  sen  teoce  of  five  y  eats'  imprisonment  and  degra  dation.  One  thousand  five  hundred  and  twenty  cases  of  maltreatment  of  subordinates  were  proved  against  him,  and  in  a  large  number  nf  ftARPK  lh  WAR  isliniirn  fhgt  lio  \\aA  nnvnnoWot   private  soldiers  under  him  to  lend  him  money  which  he  never  thought  of  returning.  The  same  revelations  were  made  as  in  preceding  trials  of  this  nature,  viz.,  when  the  judges  asked  the  men  how  they  could  put  up  with  Buch  treatment  when  they  had  the  right  to  complain,  they  invariably  replied  that  they  were  afraid  to  take  this  course  owing  to  the  vengeance  that  wonld  be  subsequently  wreaked  on  them.  DuriDE  drill  hours  the  recruits  were  in   mortal  terror,  for  Frnnzky  used  to  6ay  'Now  we  are  alone,'  and  then  maltreated  them  with  every  possible  refinement  of  cruelty.  During  these  periods  he  posted  two  men  outside  the  building  with  orders  to  report  immediately  the  arrival  of  the  lieutenant.  One  witness  said  he  had  been  compelled  to  carry  a  heavy  coalscuttle  for  half  an  hour  rminn  Ann  round  a  warm  mnm  Arwitliat*   was  compelled  to  stand  in  a  bucket  and  then  jump  out  aud  in  again  till  the  sergeant  tired  of  watching.  Another  confessed  to  having  been  beaten  300  times,  perhaps  more.  Another  was  compelled  to  pnlish  a  bucket  on  his  knees,  and  while  in  that  position  was  repeatedly  kicked  by  Pranzky.  He  was  also  ordered  to  go  through  exercises  in  front  of  a  warm  stove  till  he  sank  from  exhaustion.  Medical  ex  perts  say  that  this  witness  will  throughout  hia  life  be  subject  to  fits  brought  on  by  con  stant  and  brutal  maltreatment.  Franzky  spat  in  the  men's  faces  at  will,  struck  them  in  the  face  with  bis  fist  and  beat  them,  preferably  when  they  were  undressed,  with  a  broomstick,  which  he  named  '  King  Frederick  Wilbelm.'  When  thia  broomstick  was  broken  by  long  service  he  procured  an  other,  which  he  christened  '  Frederick  the  Great.'  Another  witness  swore  that  Franzky  made  him  run  his  head  sevBral  times  agaiutst  a  wall,  which,  said  the  man,  '  hurt  him  severely.  Another  soldier  who  Was  compelled   to  perform  the  same  operation  had  a  bucket  of  water  poured  o;er  his  head  afterwards  'to  cure  him  of  stupidity.'  Every  day  the  ruer  were  beaten,  struck,  or  made  to  go  through  the  most  exhausting  and  unnecessary  exer  cise,  merely  evidently  to  gratify  the  sergeant's  depraved  desire  to  witness  another  man's  pain.",1904-02-03T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/100489928,"Most extraordinary evidence was given at the trial by court martial at Rendsburg of Sergeant Franzky, which ended in the sentence of five yeats' imprisonment and",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article100489928?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1900-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1909-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,The Braidwood Dispatch and Mining Journal (NSW : 1888 - 1954),135.33221435546875,very relevant

113300874,GERMAN INTERFERENCE.,"  GERMAN  INTERFERENCE.   LONDON,  October  18.  —  Dr.  'Morrison,  the  Pe  kin  correspondent  of  the  'Times,'  recalls  that  Germany  in  deference  to  Russia's  wishes  in  1901,  affirmed  that  Manchuria  was  outside  the  Anglo-German  agreement.  Now,  for  the  pur   pose  or  embarrassing  Great  Britain,  Germany  has  persuaded  China  that  if  the  British  treaty  with  Thibet  is  confirmed  as  it  stands  Germany  may  demand  prescriptive  rights  in  Shantung,  France  may  make  similar  claims  on  Yunnan,  and  Japan  on  Fo-kien.  Tang-shao-yi,  the  Chinese  representative  at  Lhassa,  has  been  instructed  to  seek  at  Cal  cutta  a  modification  of  the  treaty  to  save  China's  face.  The  Vienna  correspondent  of  the  'Times,'  says  that  Germany  has  possibly  over-reached  herself  in  exerting  pressure  on  China  at  this  juncture.

Russia  and  Great  Britain  as  great  Asiatic  Pow  ers  admit  that  they  have  a  mutual  right  to  speak  with  a  view  of  adjustment  of  their  own  differences,  and  both  resent  the  gratuitous  in  terference  of  a  third  Power  having  no  claim  to  speak  as  an  Asiatic  Power.  Russia  has  -informed  the  Court  of  Pekin  of  the  clauses  which  she  considers  objectionable  m  the  British  treaty  with  Thibet,  and  has  stated  that  these  objections  are  not  intended  to  imply  the  slightest  animosity  to  Great  Britain.",1904-10-19T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/113300874,"LONDON, October 18.—Dr. Morrison, the Pekin correspondent of the ""Times,"" recalls that Germany in deference to Russia's wishes in 1901, affirmed that Manchuria was outside the",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article113300874?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1900-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1909-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"Evening News (Sydney, NSW : 1869 - 1931)",135.33221435546875,very relevant

142123989,GERMAN SPREADEAGLEISM.,"  GERMAN  SPEEADEAGLEISM.   A  prominent  German  newspaper  baa  opened  oat  with,  another  hysterical  tirade  against  Great  Britain.  This  in  stance  of  spread-eagleism  might  well  be  dismissed,  as  others  have  been,  but  that  it  acquires  special  significance   from  tbe  fact  that  the  journal  in  which  it  appears  is  frequently  the  mouthpiece  of  the  Government  —  which  in  international  affairs  really  means  the  impetuous,  ambitious  Kaiser  —  and  touches  upon  tbe  vital  question  of  what  Power  really  controls  the  destiny  of  European  politics.  Great  Britain  is  warned  not  to  provoke  a  decision  on  the  subject,  because  of  the  world  wide  significance  and  effect  attaching  to  it.  In  other  words  Germany  infer  entially  threatens  that  if  the  issue  is   provoked  Bhe  will  contest  any  decision  adverse  to  her  aspirations  in  that  con  nection.  Tbe  greatest  of  the  Kaiser's  many  ambitions  is  unquestionably  that  Germany  should  gain  that  indefinite,  yet  all  important,  quality  known  as  the  '  balance  of  power.'  Every  move  in  policy,  every  increase  of  the  navy  and  the  army  is  conceived  with  that  objective  in  view;  it  is  almost,  if  not  quite,  an  obsession  with  the  Monarch.  How  far  this  spirit  and  the  prepara  tions  which  How  from  it  can  ba  effec   tive,  must  remain  iu  uuuoi  uum  ??  test  has  been  applied.  In  tbe  interim  Germany  remains  the  cause  of  unrest  amongst  the  nations,  and  because  of  her  strenuousnesss  in  almost  every  part  of  the  world  has  to  be  closely  watched,  even  by  the  smaller  powers.  It  can  well  be  understood  that  a  nation  with  such  ambitions  as  Germany  has  chafes  under  the  '  diplomatic  net  '  which  has  been  woven  around  her,  and  for  which  Great  Britain  has  to  thank  the  late  Lord  Salisbury,  whose  apprecia  tion  of  the  importance  of  the  Empire's  relations  with  the  other  Powers  has  resulted  in  the  creation  of  what  is  ad  mitted  to  be  the  ablest  diplomatic  service  in  the  world.  That  service  has  unquestionably  checkmated  Ger  many,  maintained  Great  Britain's   prestige  and,  by  .the  intervening  of  interests,  made  her  position  more  secure  and  yet  left  an  outlet  for.  the  policy  of  'grand  isolation'  which  Lord  Salisbury  considered  so  essential  to  her  supremacy.  Germany  may  at  tempt  to  capture  the  '  balance  of  power  '  by  a  revolt  against  the  tight  ening  cordon  of  diplomacy,  tbe  con  tinued  increase  -of  her  naval  and  mer  cantile  fleets,  and  her  army.  Bat  how  long  could  such  an  aggressive  nation,  inclined  to  riding  rough-shod  over  obstacles,  maintain  that  power  when  in  the  high  stirrups,  assuming  that  altitude  was  attained  9  Not  for  long,  we  believe.  So  long  as  Great   Britain  maintains  the  two-power  de  fence,  the  balance  of  power  is  likely  to  remain  with  her.  But  at  Germany's  rate  of  battleship  construction  that  position  is  being  jeopardised.  It  is  probably  Great  Britain's  realisation  of  that  fact  which  the  German  semi  official  newspaper  regards  as  provoca  tion  for  testing  the  issue  of  supre  macy,  and  for  the  spreadeaglelsm  in  which  it  indulges  with  reference  to  tbe  capabilities  of  the  army.  Though  hysterical,  however,  the  declaration,  emanating  from  what  is  frequently  the  mouth-piece  of  the  Government,  may  or  may  not  have  official  founda  tion  ;  at  any  rate  it  is  worth  noticing.",1907-03-14T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/142123989,A prominent German newspaper bas opened out with another hysterical tirade against Great Britain.

15022599,GERMAN FINANCES.,"  GERMAN  FINANCES.   Herr  Von  Koenneritz  writes   Sir,—In  connection  with  the  ""Economist's""  state-   ment  regarding  the  position  of  the  German  finances,   it  may  not  be  without  interest  to  remind  your  readers   that,  compared  with  the  estimates  for  1907,  viz.,  1,187,600,000  marks,  the  Empire's  receipts  during  last  year  totalled  1,201,100,000  marks;  that  is,  roughly  13,500,000  marks,  or  about  1  per  cent  more  than  had  been  anticipated.  Compared  with  1906,  all  sources  of  revenue,  except  two  show  increases,  as,  for  instance,  Customs  duties,  643,000,000  marks,  or  88,400,000  marks  more  than  during  the  previous  year.  Tobacco  and  cigar-   ettes  excise  duties  23,600,000  marks,  or  7,000,000  marks  more,  distilled  excise  duties  112,600,000  marks,  or  7,800,000  marks  more,  brewing  excise  duties  51,100,000  marks,  or  8,200,000  marks  more,  etc.  The  two  excep-  tions  referred  to  are  the  stamp  duties  on  revenue-pro-  ducing  stocks  and  on  Bourse  transactions,  which  together   yielded  22,900,000  marks  less  than  in  1906.  But  against  this  it  should  be  remembered  that  they  had  been  un-  naturally  high  during  that  year.  All  other  sources  of  revenue  together  show  an  increase  of  160,000,000  marks  in  round  figures,  so  that  if  we  deduct  the  lesser  yield  of  the  Bourse  transactions,  there  still  remains  for  1907  an  excess  of  revenue  of  137,000,000  marks  in  round  figures  as  compared  to  the  previous  year.  Moreover,  the  fact  should  not  be  lost  sight  of  that  of  the  new  duties  passed  in  1906,  obviously  none  were  able  to  yield  their  full  measure  of  revenue  in  1907.  This  will  only  be  the  case  in  1910,  and  not  before.  This  much,  however,  may  safely  be  predicted—that  the  expecta-  tions  which  led  to  the  imposition  of  the  new  duties  will  be  fully  justified;  in  fact,  in  some  instances,  the  yield  has  already  come  up  to  the  estimates.",1908-07-06T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/15022599,"Herr Von Koenneritz writes:— Sir,—In connection with the ""Economist's"" statement regarding the position of the German finances, it may not be without interest to remind your readers",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15022599?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1900-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1909-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954),135.33221435546875,very relevant

152033934,GERMAN INTENTIONS,"  GERMAN  INTENTIONS   The  opinion  formed  by  the  Bishop  of  Salisbury  as  to  the  trend  of  thought  in  Germany  about  war  with  Britain  comes  opportunely  by  cable  for  com  parison  with  the  mail  brought  views  of  some  other  observers  and  critics  of  Germany's  warlike  preparations.  And   it  is  interesting  to  find  that,'  leaving  out  of  consideration  the  question1  whe  ther  there  is  any  -real  desire  for  war  on  the  part  of  the  people  of  Germany,  the  Bishop's  discovery  of  'a  consider  able  desire  for  the  possession  of  such  naval  and  military  supremacy  as  might  enable  Germany  -to  dictate  to  Europe  in  a  crisis,  or,  if  necessary,  to  the   United  States,'  is  very  muchi  in  har  mony  with  what  Captain  Mahan,  an  American  thinker  and  writer  of  accept  ed  authority  on  such  subjects,  recently  addressed  to  his  fellow  countrymen.  In  an  article  in  'Collier's  Weekly,'  Cap  tain  Mahan  calls  upon  Americans  to  give  their  attention  to  the  recent  change  in  Germany's  .  shipbuilding  capacity,  as  revealed  by  the  British  Prime  Minister  and  Admiralty.  He  says  :  'j[  believe  an  extraordinary  situa  tion  ihas  been  created,  and  that  hence  forward,  if  Germany  so  will  and  can  find  the  money,  the  two-Power  '  stand  ard  of  the  Britisk  Fleet,  accepted  by  Liverals  as  well  as  Conservatives,  can  not  be  maintained.  .  -  Few  persons  realise  what  the  appearance  of  such  a  navy  as  that  which  Germany  is  build  ing  means  in  international  affairs.  The  question,  indeed,  as  not  what  she  in-,  tends;  like  other  Governments,  she  may  to  some  extent  live  from  hand  to1  mouth,  though  probably  not  eo  much  so  as  others.  The  question  is:  What  will  she  be  able  to  do  with  such  a  force?  That  is  her  meaning:  the  expediency  of  an  unknown  future,  as  yet  contingent,  and  impossible  to  fore  see.  But  though  contingencies  are  beyond  our  ken,  it  is  perfectly  know  able,  and  absolutely  sure,,  that,  should  they  be  unfavorable,  6he,  with  a  decisively  superior  navy,  will  have  the  whip  hand.'  In  'The  United  Service  Gazette'  Captain  E.  H.  James  deals  with  the  same  aspect  of  Germany's  naval  operations,  and  points  out  that  the  British  policy  ihas  been  to  fight,  'with  absolute  impartiality,  for  or  against  every  great  Power  on  the  continent,  as  circumstances  demanded,'  to  'prevent  any  Power,  or  group  of  Powers,  from  obtaining  domination  over  Europe.''  For,  in  other  words;  'our  sea  supre  macy  depends  upon  our  ability  to  main  tain  the  balance  of  power  in  Europe.'  In  the  'Insurance  and  Banking  Re  cord'  we  find  'Jotter'  advising  those  who  would  understand  the  situation  of  to-day  to  read  Ellis  Barker's  great  work  'The  Rise  and  Decline  of  the  Netherlands.'  After*  pointing  to  the  warning  of  the  fate  of  Holland,  this  writer  says:  'Presently  -we  shall  have  to  tighten  our  belts  and  set  our  teeth  and  go  on  short  commons  to  repel  a  similar  attack  ;  and,  please  God,  with  -the  same  result.  -  .  .

All  the  temperate  regions  \of  the  earth,  however;  are  now.  occupied,  and  the  Germans  realise  that  what  they  require  must  be  -obtained'  (in  the  last  resort)  by  force  of  arms.  Hence  these  preparations.  A  glance  at  the  map  of  the  world  will  show  that  there  arc  three  tracts  of  land  in  't>he  Southern  Hemisphere  which,  by  reason  of  their  slight  population,  may  bo  regarded  as  possible  objectives  of  German  imperial  enterprise.  These  are  the  two  British  colon  ial  States—  South  Africa  and  Australia—  and  the  southern  portion  of  South  America:  South  Africa  (the  possession  of  which,  we  re  cognise  as-  essentlul  ;  to  our  hold  on  India)  is  near  enough  to.  England  to  lie  readily  de  fensible  without  -an  undue  weakening.  -of  our  available  resources.  The  case  of  Australia,  however.  Is  different.  Relying  on  the  ability  t>f  thv-  mother  (:ou»j/.vy  to  protect  her,  she  has  7/Vjrsued  a  policy-  of  impossible  ideals,  and  neglected  to  secure  for  herself  the  only  roaf  strength  of  a  community—  a  large  popu-  lat'/m,  and  that  settled  on  the  land.  Aus-  trtilia  is  indeed  a  plum  ripe:  for  flicking,  but  -  ufffiRr-.'  present  ciretunsUMices  we  are  pro  bably  'strong  enough  to  resist  any  predatory  attempt  successfully,  though  the  problem  may  be  a  more  serious  one  .in  the  near  fu-  .  lure.  .The  third  tract  of  land  that  I  have  men  tioned—the  south  ol!

The  Monroe  doctrine  has  never  given  us  any  con-  -  corn,  inasmuch  as  we  have  enough  posses-  -  sions  already:  but  it  does  concern  the  Ger  mans  very  defeply,  since  it  shuts  them  out  ""  '  '  .  from  the  only  temperate  region  of  the  -earth  that  it.  is  possible  for  them  to  acquire  witli-  out  coming-  into  conflict  with  the  widespread  Vind  powerful  British  Empire.  It  seems  to  me,  sir,  that  this  is  a  fact  of  the  very  highest  importance.  May  it  not  be  '  that  the  German  fleet  is  being  built,  not  so  much  to  challenge  our  present  supremacy  at  sea  as  to  render  the  Monroe  doctrine  of  the  United  States  .  nugatory,  by  making  her  fleet  powerless  to  enforce  it?  This,  at  any  rate,  would  be  a  less  dangerous  policy  for  ,  Germany  to  pursue,  and  one  more  likely  of  immediate  success:  for  in  the  matter  of  the  Monroe  doctrine  the  United  States  '  would  stand  alone,  and  coyld  not  rely  on  our  sup  port  in  a  policy  which  has  no  pt'arfVal  bear-  '  lrtg  on  our  own  interests.

The  arguments  are  of  course  terribly  biassed  against  the  British  Empire,  but  they  overlook  one  fact  that  should  make  up  for  all  the  sins  of  England's  committing.  Where  ever  the  English  flag  floats  the  German  colonist  is  as  welcomo  as  the  Britisher;  the  German  merchant  is  given  equal  rights  to  trade  as  the  British  merchant;  his  life  and  property  is  protected,  his  religion  is  respected,  his  freedom  absolute.  When  Britain  opens  up  a  tract  of  country  in  Africa,  China  or  elsewhere,  it  is  a  distinct  gain  to  £.11  the  world.  Can  these  things  be  said  of  Germany  ?  She  owns  a  lot  of  territory  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  but  her  citizens,  as  frugal  as  industrious,  and  as  in-   telligent,  as  any  people  in  the  world,  prefer  to  emigrate  t  o  British  territory.  In  German  colonies  the  German  merchant  is  given  a  preference  over  all  other  nations,  German  goods  are  not  taxed  like  British  goods  are.  When  Germany  secures  a  tract  of  country,  that  territory  is  lost  to  all  the  world,  the  exports  thcreform  go  to  Germany  on  German  ships,  the  imports  thereto  must  come  from  Germany.  The  country  is  administered  not  for  its  own  good  but  to  the  benefit  of  its  master,  much  the  same  as  Britain  used  to  have  India  administered  over  half  a  century  ago.

127564156,GERMAN.,"  GERMAN.   Herr  Dernburg,  the  Kaiser's  Press  agent  for  America,  and  probably  one  of  the  most  blun-  dering  and  thoughtless  persons  in  the  World,  has  deemed  it  fit  to  deliver  himself  publicly  on  the  subject  of  —  tact!   It  was  at  a  meeting  of  a  league  newly-form-  ed  in  Berlin  with  a  view  to  expanding  German  industrial  interests  in  the  South  American  continent.  Herr  Dernburg,  who  had  been  elec-  ted  president,  said,  according  to  a  Reuter  mes-  sage  from  Amsterdam  received  recently:  —  'Germany  has  only  a  few  friends  in  the  world.  Feeling  in  South  America  is  divided,  and  real  neutrality  in  North  America  is  also  doubtful.  'It  is  not  uninteresting  to  note  how  Lord  Haldane  at  Manchester  explained  to  British  merchants  that  now  a  favorable  opportunity  had  come  to  snatch  away  from  Germany  her  commercial  supremacy  for  ever.  ""For  generations  to  come,  we  need  not  fear  competition  abroad,  though,  if  the  present  war  ,.?.'.  Iasts  a  long  time,  commerce  will,  at  last,  be  obliged  to  find  new  outlets,  and  the  recapture  of  the  ground  now  lost  will  become  more  dif-  ficult.  ""For  coal  and  iron  South  America  will  be  dependent  on  the  industrial  States  for  a  long  time  to  come,  and,  therefore,  the  investment  of  more  capital  in  South  America  will  be  well  worth  while  for  commercial  reasons,  and  also  in  order  to  regain  lost  ground.  ''Besides  strengthening  our  economic  influ-  ence,  the  obtaining  of  a  certain  intellectual  influence  will  be  of  an  importance  which,  up   till  now,  has  been  greatly  under-estimated.

144792699,German [?],"  German  Ideas  of  Peace   By  D.  Thomas  Curtin   It  is  a  mistake  to  suppose,  when  reading  of  peace  talk  in  Germany,  that  the  topic  is  a  new  one  there.  It  is  not.  I  heard  the  German  people  talking  peace  a  month  after  the  outbreak  of  war—of  a  peace   to  be  sure  which  Germany  would  dictate  and  keep.  When  the  Fatherland  was  winning  I  heard  no  discordant  note.  That  was  owing   to  the  general  belief  in  and  eager-  ness  for  certain  victory  and  vast  annexation  which  prevailed  then.  To-day  the  Germans  —  with  the  exception  of  a  minority  of  extreme  Social  Democrats  —  are  no  less  united  in  their  desire  to  get  all  they  can,  but  they  are  not  all  united  in  their  opinions  as  to  how  much  they  can  get.  Hence,  after  the  French  definitely  blocked  the  German  of-  fensive  at  Verdun  and  the  British  Fleet  grip  more  and  more  tightly  the  economic  life  of  German,  a     bewildering  variety  of  Kriegsziele  (war  aims)  was  discussed  by  all  classes  of  people.  The  National  Liberal  Party  in  Germany,  as  I  have  already  in-  dicated  in  a  previous  article  on  submarines,  is  backing  a  gigantic  and  aggressive  plan  for  German  world-domination  through  a  colossal  organisation  and  expansion  of  Ger-  man  commerce  and  industry.  The  great  captains  of  industry  who  con-  trol  the  party  believe  in  the  em-  ployment  of  the  German  Army  and  Navy  to  further  their  ends  —  i.e.,  to  secure  permanently  for  Germany   the  mining  regions  of  Northern  France  and  the  coal  and  shipping  of  Belgium  ;  and  to  cripple  rival  commerce,  not  only  as  a  means  of  winning  the  war,  but  also  of  limit-  ing  competition  against  them  after  wards.  These  are  the  men  behind  Tirpitz,  and  they  are  working,  and  will  continue  to  work,  to  restore  him  to  power.  Dr  Stresemann,  one  of  the  most  influential  National  Liberals,  is  a  dynamo  of  energy  in  German  com-  mercial  plans.  His  eyes  sparkling  with  zeal,  reddish  hair,  a  clear,  metallic  voice,  he  is  a  heavy  man  physically,  wielding  a  tremendous  and  growing  power  in  Germany  to-  day.  He  has  a  controlling  interest  in  a  recently  organised  combination  of  some  two  thousand  manufactur-  ing  firms,  and  is  practically  dictator  of  the  Sachsische  Handelsgesell-  schaft  and  the  Deutsch-Amerikan-  ische  Wirthschaftsverband.  He  became  one  of  theChancellor's  most  out-spoken  enemies  at  the   time  of  the  Danish  concessions  to  America,  and  his  fiery  advocacy  of  relentless  submarine  warfare  has  earned  him  a  reputation  for  fright-  fulness,  even  in  Germany.  He  be-  longs  to  the  Western  School  of  pre-  sent-day  Germany  —  the  school  which  believes  in  placating  Russia  (to  be  followed  by  a  peaceful  pene-  tration  of  that  country)  and  the  smashing  as  far  as  possible  of  Britain  and  France.  As  his  utter-  ances  in  the  Reichstag  plainly  show,  he  is  passionately  anti-American  in  general  and  anti-Wilson  in  par-  ticular.  Since  he  is  one  of  the  foremost  Germans  in  the  great  campaign  against  Great  Britain  both  during  and  after  the  war,  Dr  Stresemann's  views  should  be  of  particular  in-  terest.  His  most  recent  utterances  agree  in  the  main  with  those  he  made  in  an  interview  which  he  gave  me,  and  which  I  duly  communi-  cated  to  American  newspapers  through  the  Wilhelmstrasse.  There  are,  however,  some  important  dif-  ferences  which  I  shall  point  out   later.  ""How  seriously  do  German  in-  dustrial  circles  regard  the  Paris  Economic  Conference?""  was  the  first  question  I  put  to  Dr  Strese-  mann.  ""If  one  is  to  attach  great  import-  ance  to  the  words  of  the  political  economists  of  the  Entente,""  he  be-  gan,  ""then  we  must  agree  that  we  might  have  considerable  anxiety  and  alarm  about  our  industrial  fut-  ure;  but,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  Ger-  man  industrial  circles  view  these  endeavors  of  our  enemies  with  calm-  ness  of  indifference.  ""Russia  cannot  emancipate  her-  self  from  German  industry.  As  for  France,  she  may  look  to  a  boy-  cott  of  German  wares.  Yet  that   will  make  no  appreciable  difference  in  our  world  trade,  even  though  here  and  there  we  may  drop  a  few  million  marks.  We  have  but  to  consider  France's  tremendous  losses  in  relation  to  her  already  falling  birthrate  before  the  war  to  realise  that  France  must  inevitably  sink  to  the  rank  of  a  third  rate  Power.  ""After  the  war  Great  Britain  will  probably  stand  united  against  us,  politically  and  economically,  but  we  fear  her  just  as  little  as  we  fear  Russia  and  France.  We  rely  first  of  all  upon  the  peerless  quality  of  our  goods  —  just  think  of  our  chemical,  textile,  and  toy  monopo-  lies,  and  the  like  —  and,  secondly,  we  rely  on  our  unsurpassed  mar-  kets  for  consumption.  ""In  1913  we  imported  for  ex-  ample,  from  Great  Britain  and  her  colonies  2,109  ,000,000  marks  (£105,450,000)  worth  of  goods.  Do  you  for  a  moment  believe  that  our  rival  is  going  to  sacrifice  such  a  tremendous  volume  of  business  for  the  sake  of  a  personal  spite?  Any  tariff  war  which  is  waged  against  us  can  injure  us,  but  it  is  bound  to  injure  the  side  just  as  much.  That  will  be  realised  all  the  more  in  England,  since  these  threats  drive  us  into  a  closer  trade  and  industrial  relationship  with  our  allies,  thus  affording  us  a  greater  extent  of  united  industrial  territory  to  oppose  the  industrial  chicaneries  which  our  enemies  have  developed  during  the  war.  In  this  we  shall  undoubtedly  be  successful  at  the  Peace  conference.  ""With  the  United  States  we   shall  resume  trade  immediagelyafter  the  end  of  hostilities.  The  war  has  caused  both  of  us  to  become  un-  comfortably  short  in  some.  com-  modities.  Consequently,  the  first  demands  after  our  resumption  of  trade  will  restrict  free  competition,  since  both  sides  must  limit  them-  selves  at  first  to  importing  the  most  necessary  commodities.  You  will  need  dyestuffs,  for  example  ;  we  must  have  certain  raw  materials.  ""To  be  sure,  trade  rivalry  will  be  keen  in  other  markets,  especially  in  South  America.  It  is  there  where  immense  capital  is  necessary  for  extensive  undertakings,  and  we  fully  realise  your  advantage  over  us  for  the  present  in  this  respect,  for  it  is  you  who  have  made  the  greatest  economic  gain  out  from  the  world  war,  a  gain  which  puts  millions  upon  millions  of  ready  money,  while  bleeding  Europe  will  emerge  from  the  struggle  economi-  cally  weakened.  ""We  Germans  would  not  dispute  your  legal  right  if  you  would  balance  the  munition  deliveries  to  our  enemies  with  raw  materials  and   foodstuffs  to  us.""  Dr  Streseman  then  went  on  to  explain  that  America  did  not  really  understand  Germany  because  she  looked  at  her  through  the  ""dis-  torted  eyeglasses  Of  Reuter.""  ""It  is  only  in  British  fancy,""  he  said,  ""that  we  are  going  to  wage  war  against  Brazil  or  other  South  American  States  in  order  to  establish  colonies.  ""You  look  calmly  on  while  Britain  rules  half  the  world,  while  she  militarily  controls  the  gates  of  the  world  in  Egypt,  India,   Cape  Colony,  Canada,  and  Gib-  raltar.  In  your  opinion  that  is  all  right  ;  but  if  in  peace  time  Ger-  many  indicated  that  she  wished  a  coaling  station  or  two  to  protect  her  vast  trade,  then  half  the  press  of  the  universe  rose  in  an  outcry  against  the  German  lust  for  'con-  quest'  and  the  'world  domination'  she  wished  to  establish.  We  stand  second  in  world  trade.  In  exports  we  are  only  300,000,000  marks  (£15,000,000)  behind  England,  and  we  surpassed  her  by  more  than  3,000,000,000  marks  (£150,000,  000)  in  exports,  if  we  exclude  British  exports  to  her  own  Colonial  Emgire,  which  buys  4,000,000,000  marks'  (£200,000,000)  worth  of  goods  from  her  annually,  she  would  long  ago  have  been  defeated  by  Germany  in  free  world  competition  —  defeated,  however  not  by  unfair  methods,  but  by  the  superior  qual-  ity  of  German  goods.""'  In  the  ""Through  German  Eyes""  column  of  ''The  Times""  recently  is  discernable  a  more  anxious  strain  in  Dr  Stresemann's  remarks  concerning  the  Paris  Economic  Conference.  Russia,  in  particular,  seems  to  have  considerably  dis-  mayed  him.  The  meeting  of  the  Russo-British  Chamber  of  Com-  merce  at  the  Savoy  Hotel,  at  which  Count  Benchendorff,  the  Russian  Ambassador,  presided,  should  prove  further  unpleasant  news  in  the  Fatherland.  Note  that  Dr  Stresemann  now  says:—  'We  do  not  yet  know  the  end  of  the  struggle.  We  know  that  we  are  military  invincible.  But  wherever  an  economic  heel  of  Achilles  shows  itself  England  will  make  every  attempt  to  bleed  us  to  death.  The  peace  must  include  the  restoration  of  free  competition  in  face  of  the  resolution  of  the  Paris  Conference.  When  free  com-  petition  is  restored  nothing  can  frighten  us,  because  we  know  that  in  this  freedom  Germany  can  win  the  victory.""—  ""The  Times.""",1917-03-01T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/144792699,"It is a mistake to suppose, when reading of peace talk in Germany, that the topic is a new one there.

183612020,GERMAN.,"  GRAMAN   The  social  which  was  held  in  aid  of  the  Tennis  Club  was  a  marked  success.  Although  the  weatber  was  very  threatening  about  thirty  couples  were  present.  During  tbe  evening  a  presentation  was  made  to  the  worthy   secretary,  Mr.  W.  L.  O'Brien.  Mr.  A.  Lowe  mads  the  presentation,  and  in  a  few  fitting  words  said  that  the  Club  was  indebted  to  Mr.  O'Brien  for  his  untiring  efforts  in  furthering  its  interests.  Mr.  M.  Robson  endors-  ed  the  last  speaker's  remarks,  and  said  be  hoped  that  although  Mr.  O'Brien  was  not  actually  in  harness  he  hoped  the  CIub  would  not  lose  one  of  its  most  energetic  members.  Mr.  O'Brien  in  responding,  said  he  tried  to  do  his  best  in  the  interests  of  the  Club,  but  through  pressure  of  busi-  ness  he  was  unable  to  do  it  justice,  so  he  thought  it  better  for  the  Club  if  he  allowed  some  one  else  to  fill  his  place.  He  again  thanked  the  mem-  bers,  and  said  he  would  continue  to  do  his  utmost  to  advance  its  interests.  A  tennis  match  was  played  between  Bannockburn  and  Gratnau  last  Satur-  day.  The  game  was  very  evenly  and  keenly  contested,  and  was  won  by  Bannockburn  by  the  narrow  margin  of  4  games.  We  have  experienced  several  frosts  during  the  last  few  weeks,  and  of  course  everybody  is  wishing  winter   over,  and  the  nice  warm  days  in  its  stead.  Last  Thursday  at  the  School  at  9  a.m.  it  was  32  degrees,  a  record  for  this  year  up  to  the  present.  By  the  way,  the  local  school  garden  at  the  present  is  looking  in  tip  top  order,  although  it  cannot  boast  of  a  garden  equal  to  ""Andersons""  it  will  in  the  near  future  eclipse  many  so-  called  gardens.  At  the  present  time  the  local  school  is  half-time,  but  it  is  to  be  hoped  that  before  long  it  will  be  made  into  a  provisional.

137630151,GERMAN.,"  GERMAN.  Germany's  luck  has  been  out.  To  understand  this  we  want  to  read  history.  Had  there  never  been  a  great  Empire  of  Germany,  then  possibly  there  would  now  be  a  great  German  Empire.  We  want  to  realise  that  the  old  German  Empire  was  one  made  up  of  nations,  and  that  some  of  these  did  great  pioneerlng  work  which  circumstances  linked  with  their  individual  selves.  If  Australia  were  to  take  all  New  Guinea,  and  England  approved,  it  would  be  an  Imperial  work,  and  our  language  being  the  same,  the  latter  would  stand  even  though  ultimately  we  separated.  Some  of  the  work  of  Spain  was  done  as  part  of  the  old  German  Empire:  that  is  to  say,  the  King  of  Spain  was  also  the  German  Emperor.  The  old  German  Empire  came  too  soon  in  last,  albeit  it  did  last   in  one  form  and  another  for  ages.  Permanent  Empire  is  dependent  on  rapid  transit  and  quick  intercommunications.  Without  the  stcemboat  and  the  telegraph,  and  also  railways  in  conjunction,  the  present  British  Empire  would  be  as  impossible  as  was  the  former  one.  1t  is  forgotten  that  there  was  an  Anglo-French  Empire,  even  though  not  that  the  thirteen  American  Colonies  dissolved,  the  Anglo-American  one  to  the  extent  that  they  were  responsible  for  the  title.  German  is  the  vernacular  of  a  territorially  small  section  of  the  world's  surface.  It  is  filled  in  solid  in  the  little  map.  German  is  read  or  spoken  to  some  extent  in  the  shaded  sections,  for  the  following  reasons—  in  parts  through  old  control  and  the  continued  virility  and  influence  of  the  strain,  and  over  all  through  present  Germany's  commercial  and  flinancial  relatlonships.  To  these  we  may  add  strain  derivations,  no  matter  of  what  date,  and  the  face  that  German  has  been  responsible  for  a  great  literature.  Nevertheless  partial  use  is  not  sufficient.  Partial  use  in  Germany's  case  means  that  in  many  spheres  the  language  is  merely  classical.

Co-operation  for  the  poli   tical  and  economical  consolidation  ol  Europe,  ishc  urges,  is  impossible  'without  the  immediate  evacuation  of  Allied  troop;  from  German  territory.  Germany  is  drilling  to  be  friendly,  but  resents  having  to~  bear  the  brand,  and.  burden  of  the  conquered.  Although  she  can  honestly  claim  to  have  attempted  to  make  the  reparations  plan  work,  and.  tc  be  a  fviHing  partner,  in  the  Locarno  treaties  and  a  respected  member  of  the  League  of  Nations,  she  is  not  unmind  ful  of.  the  strength  of  the  .opposition  still  offered  ""  to  her  restoration,  ;  to  '  inter  national  equality.

The  challenge  may  not  be  answered  as  promptly  as  lie  would  like;  but  it  will  doubtless  assist  in  the  inevit   able  readjustment  of  European  relatione,  j  The  plea  is  firm;  yet  it  is  significantly  j   dispassionate,  and  bCars  no  trace-of  the:  aggressiveness  which  has  marred  the   effect  of  previous  similar  pronounce-j  ments.  In  tliis  respect,  it  confirms  the  I  signs  of  the  new  spirit  of  reason  mani  fest  in  recent  developments  in  German  politics.  :  The  members  of  the  last!

187921698,GERMAN REALISM,"  GERMAN  REALISM   ""Winter,""  by  P.  Griese.  Translated  from  tbo  German  by.Adler  Hobman-  Published  by  Long  mans,-  London,  >   A  book  .as  powerful  as  it,is  gloomy  has  been  written  by  a  German  school*  master  who..has  found  his  metier  as  a  novelist,  Griese.  is  a  realist,  with  vivid  »pen  which  is  used  with  the  -  sparing  economy  of  the  artist  and  the  imagina  tion  of  the  poet.  Ilis  picture  of  an  obscure  and.isolated  farming  village  through  a  summer  of  drought  followed  by  an  early  winter  of  phenomenal  severity  will  not  readily  fade  from  the  'mind  of  those  who  absorb  his  pene  trating  chapters.  The  people  upon  whom  this  natural  affliction  is  visited  arc  purely  of  the  soilt  simple,  superstiti  ous,  self-centred,  almost  primitive  >in  their'  loves  and  •  hates.  •  The  stark  tragedy  of  that  awful  winter  which  left  the  farms  desolate  and  deserted  Is  matched  by  the  grimness  of  the  per  sonal  histories  unfolded.  Men  and  women  alike  have  the  stolidness  com-?  mon.  to  the  uneducated  and  specially  characteristic'  of  the  German  rustic,  and  from  this  quality  the  author  has  weaved  material  that  has  all  the  elements  of  social  drama.  The  hero  Jona  is  the  illegitimate  offspring  of  a  farmer's  daughter  and  an  .  alien  labourer  who  had  been  turned  from  the  farm-  when  his  attentions  to  .the  girl  became  apparent.  Jona  has  all  the  in  articulateness  .of  the  countryman  and  withstands  every  effort  to  induce  him  to  set  about  getting  a  wife.  Clearly  he  likes  Grita,  a  neighbouring  farmer's  daughter,  but  hesitates  to  speak,  and  a  less  unwilling  wooer  in  his  cups  forces  his  attentions  on  her  with  a  crudity  which  leaves  Grita  in  her  unr  sophisticated  simplicity  with  no  alter  native  but  to  marry""  the  man.  But  she  determined  to  be  wife  .  only  in  name  and  a  grim  scene  on  her  wedding,  night  is  only  averted  by  the  worse  tragedy  of  the  discovery  that  a  wronged  younger  sister  has  killed  herself  under  stress  of  taunts  at  the  wedding  supper  table.  Grita  and  her  Thord  in  their  estranged  relations  presents  a  ""strange  commentary  on  village  heroics,  -and  the  tense  situation  is  ended  by  Jona  fighting  him  to  the  death.  Out  of  the  village  in  which  relentness  snow  storms  had  wrought  despair  and  star  vation  the  victor  and  Grita  pass  ""into  some  shadowy  prospect  of  a  happier  future.  The  story  is  a  masterpiece  .of  fiction  and  carries  the  commendation  of  having  won  two  literary  prizes.  •",1929-06-07T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/187921698,"""Winter,"" by F.

232435291,GERMAN REPARATIONS,"  GERMAN  REPARATIONS   What  should  Germany  pay?  In  theory,  the  whole  cost  of  the  war  which  she  provoked.  But  the  bitter  truth  was  long  ago  recognised—first  by  Britain  and  last  of  all  by  exasper  ated  France—that  neither  Germany  nor  anyone  else  could  possibly  foot  the  whole  bllL  Moral  obligation  had  to  give  way  to  potential  fact,  and  the  question  became  not  what  ""should'  but  what  ""can""  Germany  pay?  That   matter  was  closely  studied  through  long  years,  averaging  and  calculatin;  on  a  basis  entirely  business-like,  ant'  fixed  amounts  were  determined,  fai  below  the  fair  but  touching  only  the  possible.  No  one  expected  the  Germans  to  welcome  this  minimum,  but  at  least  it  was  thought  that  they  would  feel  that  they  had  done  pretty  well  in  comparison  .with  what  might  have  been  insisted  on  (and  what  they  themselves  would  have  exacted,  if  victorious,  from  others).  Acceptance  of  the  Inevitable  should  surely  have  been  their  proper  course.  Instead  of  this,  however,  we  find  ourselves  face  to  face  with  new  demands  for  further  remissions.  An  Insidious  campaign  'in  forma  pauperis""  has  been  steadily  afoot  Against-this,  the  French  have  unceasingly  .protested,  though  in  England  a  certain  degree  of  sympathy  has  at  times  been  mildly  shown.  British  opinion,  however,  has  now  been  considerably  stiffened  by  the  Parker  Gilbert  report  That  document,  apart  altogether  from  its  highly  convincing  business  side,  merely  puts  into  words  the  justifiable  conviction  of  the  average  Briton,  who,  not  at  all  disposed  to  kick  even  the  most  ruthless  enemy  when  down,.  Is  nevertheless  quite  tinable  .to  see  why  the  losers  of  a  wanton  and  deliberate  war  should  suffer  from  its  effects  In  a  less  degree  than  those  who  ltchleTed  a  defensive  victory.  Forthatwas  all  that  the  Allies  gained  br,could  gain  —  successful  resistance,to  ^threatened  destruction.:  In  gaining:  tt^toiey';«^p)£nitned  themselves,  nonejnoreso  than  Britain.  And  It  certainly  the  TOrr  Climaxof  unreason  that  reparations  (there  Is  no  question  ol  ^nflemnitles)  which  have  already  bpen^ifeed  flown  to  tar  betow  &e  st&3ard  i>f  :«hat  would  have  been  :  righ^i^  jMtlce  should  t>e  the  iBeonans  .  gome-   what  inconvenient  All  tiie  evidence  suggests  that  Britain  is  even  yet  bear  ing  heavier  burdens  than  they,  having  lost  some  of  her  markets  even  to  the  Germans  themselves.  At  present:  most  of  Britain's  sympathy  and  concern  are  sorely  needed  for  lier  own  family,  and  -what  there  is  over  and  to  spare  may  well  be  extended  rather  to  Germany's  victims  than  to  Germany.  This  is  cold  justice,  not  hot  vindictiveness.  Britain  does  not  bear  ill-will.  Hp  to  almost  the  outbreak  of  the  war,  Germany  had  her  friendship,  for  the  mass  of  our  ""people  disregarded  all  warning.  That  friend  ship  she  deliberately  destroyed  though  even  already,  after  all  that  has  happened,  there  arc  signs  that  she  may  gradually  recover  it  if  she  conducts  herself  with  ordinary  sense.  She  won  back  a  certain  amount  of  respect  from  the  discerning  by  her  refusal  tc  go  Bolshevik  at  a  time  when  temptation  pointed  to  that  course  as  s  possible  escape  from  all  debts  whatever.  Having  resisted  that,  her  pose  of  mendicancy  comes  with  all  the  poorer  spirit.  Nor  •will  it  be  accept  ed.  The  mere  proposal  has  united  the  Allies  more  closely  again,  drawn  Britain  nearer  to  the  French  point  ""of  vie.  Germany  has  hitherto  been  remarkably  lucky,  not  through  deserv   ings  but  by  force  of  circumstances  She  ought  to  recognise  that,  and  not  to  lodge  appeals  which  border  very  closely  on  presumption.",1929-01-05T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/232435291,"What should Germany pay?

""Her  people  are  working  harder  than  any  others,  at  lower  wages,  and  with  more  efficient  organisation.  They  have  been  braced  by  defeat,  whereas  the  victor  nations,  and  above  all  Great  Britain,  have  been  slackened  by  victory,""  he  writes  in  the  ""Review  of  Reviews.""  The  Change  in  the  People.  ""When  I  went  first  into  Germany  after  the  armistice  the  people  seemed  stupefied  by  what  had  befallen  them.  All  their  faith  had  been  shattered  by  the  downfall  of  their  armies,  and  they  were  afraid  of  revolution,  and  hopeless.  ly  uncertain  of  the  future.  Many  of  them,  ;especially  the  women  and  chil  dren,  were  still  suffering  from  the  effects'  of  long  under-feeding,  ,prices  of  food,  clothing,  and  other  necessities  of  life  were  above  the  reach  of  working  folk,  demobilised  soldiers  were  not  yet  assimilated  into  civil  life.  and  the  spirit  of  the  people  was  dejected  and  de  spairing.  ""Now,  in  Berlin  the  general'  appear  ance  of  the  people  is  not  miserable  but  cheerful,  not  dejected  but  alert  and  con  fident.  One  does  not  see  crowds  of  listless  unemployed  men  hanging  about  labour  exchanges  or  rattling  collecting  boxes  in  the  faces  of  the  passers-by.  One  sees  crowds  of  men  stepping  out  briskly,  obviously  employed,  well-dressed,  well-fed,  keen""  on  their  jobs,  doing  good  business.  Krupp's  5s.  Day.  ""The  German  working  man  in  Krupp's  factories  and  others,  is  paid  60  marks  a  day.  At  the  old  value  of  the  mark  that  would  be  £3.  At  the  present  value,  inside  Germany  itself,  I  reckon  it  as  five  shillings.  ""For  an  eight-hour  day  it  works  out  at  74d.  an  houi  compared  with  1s.  9d.  to  2s.  6d.  an  hour  of  the  mechanic  in  \Great  Britain.  ""The  German  working  man  on  60  marks  a.  day  gets  almost  enough  to  eat  (never  enough  meat),  almost  enough  to  support  a  wife  and  small  family,  almost  enough  to  make  himself  satisfied'  with  his  job.  By  strict  attention  to  economy,  he  can  squeeze  out  a  few  marks  for  the  simple  pleasures  of  his  leisure  hours,  which  consist  mostly  in  light  beer  and  light  music  in  some  public  garden  or  beer-hall.  ""The  professional  classes,  and  the  clerical  classes  (city  clerks,  typists,  etc.)  are  not  so  well  off  relatively  as  the  mechanics'  and  labourers.  Whereas  the  cost  of  living  has  increased  from  eight  to  10  times,  the  salaries  of  professors,  teachers,  civil  .servants,  and  others  have  only  risen  from  4  to  6  times.  It  is  they  who  are  most  pinched  'and  reduced  to  desperate  straits  in  order  to  'keep  up  appear  ances.  .  A  New  Industrial  Organisation.  ""Now,  upon  the  great  mass  of  cheap  labour  German  capitalists  are  building  up  a  new  and  intensive  sytem  .of  indus  trial  organisation,  beyond  anything  the  world  has  previously  seen  in  efficiency  and  driving  power.  Hugo  Stinnes,and  his'great  Trust,  controlling  a  vast  mo  nopoly  of  coal,  iron  and  steel,  of  whom  there  has  been  much  talk,  because  he  re  presents  most  powerfully  'this  new  phase  of  German  energy,  is  only  one  of  a  score  of  other  magnates  who  prac  tically  control  the  whole  industrial  life  of  .Germany,  and  are  the  real  rulers  of.  the  State.  ""Their  method  is  what  is  described  as  the  creation  of  'vertical'  trusts.  That  is  to  say,  by  a  combination  and  pool  ing  of  many  companies  in  possession  of  raw  material  and  industrial  plant  they  build  up  an  immense  production  .of  manu  factured  articles  which  have  that  raw  material  as  their  basis.  Krupp's  Peaceful  Output.  ""Thus  the  great  munition  works  of  Krupp,  entirely  engaged  in,  the  produc  tion  of  guns  and  armaments  during  the  war  'bon  a  colossal  scale,  read  the  lesson  of  defeat,  and  within  a  few  months  after  the  Armistice,  adapted  their  plant  and  their  organising  genius  in  a  marvellous  way  to  the  requirements  of  peace.  They  are  now  making  engines  and  machinery  of  all  kinds,  agricultural  implements,  cash  registers,  safety  razors,  and  any  kind  of  article  in  iron  and  steel  for  which  there  is  a  world  market.  The  General  Electric  Company  is  also  de  veloping  its  energy  with  gigantic  strides,  reaching  out  to  'neutral'  countries  and  absorbing  many  industrial  concerns  of  which  the  basis  of  activity  is  coal  and  iron  and  electrical  power,  in  Austria,  Hungary,  and  other  countries..  ""These  great  Trusts,  are  already  cap  turing  the  world's  markets,  and  have  already  succeeded  in  recovering  some  of  the  pre-war.  prosperity  of  German  trade-which  is  almost  a  miracle  con  sidering  the  ruin  of  the  German  economic  system  by  the  exhaustion  of  a  bloody  and  unsuccessful  war,  the  loss  of  colonies,  shipping,  and  foreign  pro  perty,  the  loss  of  man  power,  and  the  deterioration  of  machinery,  railways,  and  rolling  stock.  Imports  Falling  Off.  '¶masing  as  all  this  is,  however,  one  must  not  exaggerate  the  actual  results.  Germany  is  not  rolling  in  wealth,  as  some  observers  have  reported.  Apart  alto  gether  from  her  international  debts  leaving  on  one  side  altogether  the  gigantic  payments  of  the  indemnities  which  she  has  undertaken-her  industry  and  com  merce  are  about  two-thirds  normal  com  pared  with  the  pre-war  standard.  Her  imports  of  cotton  amount  to  nearly  half  of  thcse  in  1913.  Her  ioal  output  during  the  first  four  months  of  this  year  was  44,500,000  tons  compared  with  57,000,000  toxas  in  the  same  period  of  1913.  ""Half  the  amount  of  pre-war  tonnage  (largely  under  foreign  flags)  is  now  coming  into  the  port  of  Iamburg.   If  They  Pay!  ""All  this  is  a  sign  of  industrial  and  conmmunercial  recovery,  astoundmg  as  a  proof  of  cnergy,  industry,  and  organised  efficiency,  after  the  shock  of  national  de  feat.  But  those  German  people  who  have  put  up  such  a  tremendous  fight  for  their  old  place  in  the  world  are  now  confronted  with  the  necessity  of  paying  indemnities  to  the  victor  nations  which  will  test  their  power  of  recovery  to  the  uttermost  and  demand  new  and  unpre  cedented  efforts.  It  is  not  going  to  be  easy  for  them  to  pay.  If  they  suc  ceel,  it  will  be  the  greatest  industrial  adventure  ever  undertaken  by  any  people  in  the  world.  To  succeed  they  must  in  crease  their  volume  of  exports  by  at  least  fotir  times,  which  would  be  an  achievement  unrivalled  in  the  industrial  history  of  the  world.  Con  they  do  that.  and  if  they  do  what  will  be  the  effect  upon  other  nations?  ""It  has  already  been  asked  by  Mr.  Reginald  McKenna.  What  will  happen  to  British  trade  if  Germany  pays  her  indemnities  in  the  only  way  possible  by  an  immense  increase  of  exports?  The  very  fulfilment  of  her  pledges  will  ruin  the  countries  receiving  payment  by  the  destruction  of  their  own  export  trade.  .o  we  reach  the  monstrous  para  dox  that  in  shouting  *Make  Germany  pay!'  we  were  insisting  upon  our  own  ruin.  The  only  aure  for  the  present  sickness  of  world  trade  is  to  return  to  normal  canditions  of  imports  balancing  exports,  and  of  a  free  and  natural  flow  of  trade.  ""Condensing  very  briefly  the  results  of  my  visit  to  Berlin,  it  will  be  seen  that  in  my  opinion  Germany  will  make  a  serious  endeavour  to  fulfil  her  pledges,  and  is  in  a  fair  way  (if  she  retains  the  resources  of  ,her  raw  material  in  Upper  Silesia  and  elsewhere)  to  capture  the  industrial  supreieny  of  Europe.""",1921-09-26T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/28003933,"Sir Philip Gibbs gives a remarkable account of the new spirit and the renewal of industry in Germany.

The  Liverpool  ""Corn  Trade  News""  of  June  8,  said:—'""The  salient  feature  ot  the  barley  position  in  2Jorth  America-  >s  the  heaviness  of  receipts  at  Winnipeg.  It;  was,  of  course,  a  foregone  conclusion  that  riio  country  elevator  .stocks  would  ccme'  forward,  freely  as  apon.  as  elevator  I  was  available  at  head  -of  lakes,  and  the  actual  movement  is  certainly  liberal,  the  Canadian  receipts  for  -the  third  week  of.  Hay  totalling  649  carloads,  compared  with  439  at  all  the  chief  United  States  north  western  centres,  including  Chicago.  Hail  advices  from  San  EVanci?co  say  that  the  new  Californian.  crop  is  cot  yet  moving  to  an  appreciable  extent.  In  the  Pacific  north-west  there  has  been  some  drought  damage,  but  a  good  crop  is  still  expected  there,  whilst  in  other  parts  of  the  United  States  and  in  Canada,  prospects  are  favorable,  although  more  rain  is  wanted.  European  crops  arc  doing  weil  in  Russia,  Hungary,  Germany,  and  Great  Britain,  butFrance  complains  of  deterioration  and  Roumania  has  suffered  from  a  very  severe  storm.  North  African  reports  continue  to  speak  favorably  of  the  harvest,  and  a  cable  advice  from  our  Persian  Gulf  cor  respondent  reports  a  surplus  of  400,000  quarters  in  Iraq.  Russian  reports  continue  to  ear  that  good  quantities  arc  coming  forward  from  producing  regions,  and  we  have  no  doubt  that  a  good  part  of  this  barley  will  be  made  available  for  the  ex  port  trade.  DanubUn  supplies,  on  the  other  hand,  are  shrinking.  The  visible  supnly  in  the  United  States  shows  a  small  increase,  being  now  4,061,000  basliets.  compared  with  3.830,003  a  week  ago,  and  2,810,000  a  year  ago.

121943879,GERMAN PRESIDENCY.,"  GERMAN  PRESIDENCY.  The  election  of  Marshal  Von  RLin  dsburg  to  the  German  Prelsidency  will  occasion  a  good  deal  of  misgiving  in  Europe,  and  particularly  In  France,  where  every  action  of  Germany  is  re  garded  with  the  gravest  suspicion.  It  is  hardly  likely,  of  cource,  that  there  will  be  any  immediate  change  of  Gcr.  man  Dolicy.  Even  the  supporters  of  the  now  President,  Jubilant  as  they  must  be,  would  not  dare  to  take  the  jisk  of  provoking  civil  war.  At  the  same  time  the  victory  of  HiIndenburg,  who  is  tihe  figurehead  of  the  Monarchists,  is  sug  gestive  of  the  growing  strength  of  that  element  which  would  turn  thle  military  defeat  of  the  Great  War  Into  a  diplo  matic  success,  or  at  least  a  draw  with  out  penalties.  There  was  a  time  when  the  aged  marshal's  name  was  one  to  conjure  with.,  iHe  was  the  Idol  of  a  deluded  people,  but  when  the  ""im  pregnable""  imne  which  bore  his  name  was  broken,  when  the  Australlans  participated  in  the  smashing  blow  that  crumpled  up  his  armies,  ficktle  fame  deserted  him.  Since  then  he  Ilas  tasted  the  sorrows  as  well  as  the  sweets  of  public  eminence.  A  hero  and  a  butt,  a  national  saviour  and  a  na   tional  scapegoat,  a  great  soldier  to  whom  a  war  fired  people  paid  bound  less  homage,.  and  a  reputed  failure  bowed  down  beneath  popular  derision,  all  these  vagaries  Von  Hindenburg  has  experienced:  and  now  he  has  emerged  from  obsburity  into  triumph.  He  has  becomen  the  leader  of  tile  German  na  tion  with.  power  to  mould  its  progress  to  his  will.  Through  all  the  conflict  of  opinion  that  filters  through  the  calbles  it  is  difficult  to  gauge  with  any  degree  of  accuracy  the  trend  of  th'ought  in  Ger  many.  Tile  statements  the  new  PrCs  dent  has  m'ale  frops  time  to  tintme  have  in  them  the  elements  of  confu  sion;  but  it  seems  reasonably  certain  that  the  nation  as  a  whole  is  by  no  means  irrevocably  coninitted  to'  tile  republican  form  of  government.  Nor  is  there  .any  sound  ground  for  believing  that  .the  nation  Is  prepared  tio  accept  the  consequences  of  the  d~feat  of  her  reckless  bid  for  world  power.  It  has  been  well  sald  thatthere  is  no  sign  of  'disarmament  of  the  intellect  in  Ger  many,""  and  the  Allied  Military  Mis  sion  has  discovered  disturbing  signs  of  purposeful  evasion  of  treaty  obliga  tions.  The  same  spirit  has  been  en  countered  in  other  directions.  The  schemes  of  successive  governments  to  outwit  theAllies  and  hscape  financial  burdens  ruined  tile  countr.y's  .cur  rency'and  shattered  its  credit.  Sonme  months  ago  we  pointed  out  that  *  the  trouble  seems  to  be  the  persistence  of  tile  Prusslan  military  caste,  backed  by  the  war  profiteers  and  imperiallaistic  intellectuals.  German  democracy  is  being  trampled  upon  by  thle  wcr  lords,  and  there  is  little  prospect  of  real  peace  until  the  yoke  of  the  Juinkers  has  been  removed  front  their  necks.  There  is  dome  consolation.  in  the  knowledge  that  the  Republican  vote  is  still  a  force  to  be  reckoned  with  in  tile  constituencieo.  In  tfact  some  of  tihe  election  figures  which  have  just  been  published  suggest  that  there  are  more  Republicans  thaAl  Monarchists.  and  whether  their  preference  for  Dr.  Marx  indicated  a  belief  that  the  Replublican  form  of  gpvernment  was  the  ideal,  or  merely  the  best  expedient  for  mollify  ing  publlec  opinion  in  othler  countries,  tile  result  is  much  thle  same.  Von  -in  denburg  cannot  afford  to  isgnore  that  feeling  entirely.  The  Reiclhstag,.  too,  is  still  committed  to  Republiceanisl.  biut  the  new  President  has  power  to  dce  the  Government  and  the  public  ser  vice  a  pronounced  Monarchist  colour  In  any  cas.e  the  realnt  damange  will  coute  from  anxiety  as  to  what  Hindlenburg  may  do.

The  singing  of  ""O,  Perfect  Love,""  by  St.  Augustine's  Church  of  England  choir,  heralded  the  arrival  of  Miss  Ag-  nes  Freeman  on  Tuesday  evening  last  for  her  marriage  to  Mr.  John  F.  W.  Luckie,  of  Booleroo,  N.S.W.,  and  form-  erly  of  Inverell.  The  bride  is  the  youngest  daughter  of  Mrs.  A.  Free-   man,  of  Inverell,  and  the  late  Mr.  A.  de  M.  Freeman,  and  the  bridegroom  is  the  only  son  of  Mr.  and  Mrs.  W.  Luckie,  of  Mendooran.  Rev.  E.  H.  Stammer  officiated  and  Miss  Patt  pre-  sided  at  the  organ.  A  veil  of  Brussels  lace,  over  a  beau-  tifully  cut  gown  of  silver  tinsel  satin,  was  worn  by  the  bride,  who  looked  radiant  on  entering  the  church,  accompanied  by  her  brother-in-law,  Mr.  E.  Hargrave,  who  subsequently  gave  her  away.  The  bride  carried  a  bouquet  of  blue  lillies  and  cornflowers,  tied  with  silver  streamers.  Miss  Mona  Delbridge  was  bridesmaid   and  wore  a  frock  of  blue  embossed  satin,  which  was  made  with  chiffon  shoulder  drapes  falling  to  the  hemline.  She  wore  a  head-dress  of  blue  tulle,  with  a  coronet  of  cream  roses,  and  carried  a  bouquet  of  cream  roses  tied  with  blue  streamers.  Mr.  A.  D.  Freeman,  brother  of  the  bride,  attended  to  the  duties  of  best  man.  The  church  was  beautifully  decorated  with  roses  and  snapdragons,  and  was  the  artistic  work  of  the  brides  many  girl  friends,  who  also  attended  to  the  decorations  in  the  Masonic  hall,  where  the  reception  was  later  held.  Here  the  color  scheme  was  carried  out  in  blue  and  white,  a  large  horse-shoe  of  white  and  silver  predominating  at  the  back  or  the  bridal  table,  presenting  a  picturesque  setting  for  the  occasion.  Large  bowls  of  sweet-peas,  roses,  and   aquelegias  graced  the  tables,  whilst  the  beautifully-decorated  two-decker  cake  held  pride  of  place.  About  one  hundred  guests  were  re-  ceived  by  Mrs.  Freeman,  who  chose  a  lovely  gown  of  black  velvet  with  black  toque,  and  carried  a  posy  of  Tal-  isman  roses.  Mrs.  E.  Hargrave  as-  sisted,  wearing  a  gown  of  blue  georget-  te.  Harding's  orchestra  was  in  at-  tendance  and  rendered  numbers  ap-  propriate  to  the  occasion,  and  later  when  the  guests  indulged  in  dancing.  When  leaving  for  the  honeymoon,  which  is  being  spent  motoring  on  the  South  Coast,  the  bride  chose  a  smart  tailored  costume,  with  navy  accessor-  ies.  The  young  couple,  whose  future  home   will  be  at  Booleroo,  N.S.W.,  were  the  recipients  of  a  beautiful  array  of  gifts,  which  were  displayed  on  tables  in  the  hall,  and  received  much  favourable  comment  from  the  guests.",1938-10-14T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/185833550,"The [?] Perfect Love,"" by St. [?] of [?] choir [?] arrival of [?]",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article185833550?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1930-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1939-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The Inverell Times (NSW : 1899 - 1907, 1909 - 1954)",150.48727416992188,very relevant

Knrl  Frank,  deputy  leader  of  the  party  and  others,  came  in^conflict-.wlth  ..the  ‘police,  as^  they  were  making  way  for  him  and  other  leaders  to  get  to  their  motor’cars  after  having  addressed’a  political  meeting  that  had  been  for  bidden  by  the  police.  The  incident  followed  the  arrest,  a  few  weeks  earl  ier,  of  another  prominent  member  of  tho'party,  Hans  Rutha,  on  non  political  charges  concerning  public   moralB.   .  The  Sudeten  .  Doutch  comprise  the  majority  of  the  large  Germun  minority  in  Czechoslovakia.  Unlike  the  mod  erate  -  minority  of  Germans,  in  that  country,  the  Sudeten  Doutsch  refuses  to  co'-operato  with  the  Czech  Govern  ment.  •  They  are  Nazi  in  outlook,  and  favour  the  establishment  of  ""MU  tel  Buropa”  under  the  influence  of  the  Tfhird  Reich.  As  an  outcome  of  the  Teplitz-Schonau  incident  their  leader  Konrad  Hcnlein,  in  a  letter  to  Presi  dent  Bones,  has  demanded  “autonomy""  for""  all  Gormans  living  in  Czechoslo  vakia,   The  German  Press  accused  the  Czech  police  of  “serious  excesses,’*  de  claring  that  “Sudetlc  Germun  patience  is  at  an  end.  The  ntmosphere  is  laden-with,  thunder,  and  a  single  spark  might'  be  '  suillclcnt  to,  turn  this  Incident  into  u^ftre  of  revolt.""  V''The  National  Zelturig  of  Bsson  (Gen.  GoerJng's  paper)  declared  that  the  in  cident  was  an  Insult,  to  70,000,000  Germans.   It  turned  again  to  accusing  the   Czech  government  of  conspiracy  with  Soviet  Russia  against  Germany,  de  claring  that  dt  was  under  Russian  ■  patronage  that  the  Czechs  oxerclscd  their  ’barbarous""  rule.  The  Czech  Press,  without  regard  to  political  party,  strongly  condemned  the  activ  ities  of  the  Sudctic  Germans,  and  re  fused  to.  publish  Henloin's  letter  to  President  Benes,  -and  Herr  Henleln’s  paper,  in  which  Ills  letter  appeared,  was  confiscated.   Meanwhile,  Dr.  Mastny,  the  Czech  Ambassador,  made  an  oRlcial  protest  in  Berlin  agaiinst  the  attitude  of  the  German  press,  blit  the  German  Foreign  Minister  rebuffed  ’  the  protest'  as  misplaced.  \r  •  ‘   Tlie  real  significance  of  the  out  break  lies  deeper,  and  is  part  of  a  long-continued  effort  by  Germany  to  get  Czechoslovakia  to  break  off  treaty  connection  with  Soviet  Russia.  Ger  man  press  propaganda  to  this  end  has  continuously  alleged  the  presence  in  Czechoslovakia  of  Russian  aviators  and  military  officers,  and  the  erection  of  Soviet  military  aerodromes  on  Czech  territory,  ns  well  as  the  build  ing  of  a  strategic  railway  which  will  link  Czechoslovakia  directly  to  Russia  through  Roumania.   Behind,  this  again  lies  the  German  dream  ~of  “Mlttel  Buropa,”  In  which  nil  the  German-speaking  people  of  Central  13urope  are  to  be  united  into  one  ’‘Grenter  Germany,”  which  will   dominate  Central  and  'Eastern  Europe:  politically  and  economically.  Ger  many  thus  seeks  a  free  hand  In  East  ern  Europe,  and  feels  she  might  achieve  it  if  she  could  discredit  -Czechoslovakia  In  the  eyes  of  the  Western  .lSuropean  nations,  particu  larly  England.  It  is  significant,  therefore,  that  opinion  in  England  is  already  divided.  Thcrp  arc  thosq  who  would  defend  the  integrity  of  Czecho  slovakia  at  all  costs,.  and  those  who  would  readily  sacrifice  the  Czechs  if  they  thought  they  could  keep  war  from  Western  Europe.   At  the-  same  lime,  another  move  ment  Is  growing  in  Central  Europe  among  the  small  nations  who  fear  tlm  they  might  be  swallowed  up  by  Ger  many.  Relations  between  Czecho  slovakia,  Austria  and  Hungary  are  more  cordial  than  ever  before,  and  might  led  to  something  like  n  defen  sive  alliance.  Germany,  on  the  other  hand,  is  countering  by  economic  pene  tration  of  Yugo-Slavla,  Bulgaria  and   Roumania.",1938-01-28T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/270362338,"The latter half of October 1937 was marked by a revival of bitter antiCzech propaganda in the German Press, The outbreak had as a",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article270362338?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1930-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1939-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,Kyabram Free Press and Rodney and Deakin Shire Advocate (Vic. : 1894 - 1955),140.80377197265625,very relevant

161051821,GERMAN DEBTS.,"  GERMAN  DEBTS.   When  Germany,  a  month  ago,  placed  an  embargo  upon  the  import  of  wool,  amongst  other  raw  materials,  it  was  noted  here  that  this  situation  had  been  arrived  at  as  part  of  a  German  programme  to  bring  pressure  to  bear  upon  her  debtors  in  regard  to  the  payment  of  the  debts  owed  by  that  country  overseas.   For  some  two  years  now  Germany  has  not  been  paying  the  interest  upon  her  debts,  whilst  instalments  of  principal  long  ago  ceased.  A  crisis  has  now  been  reached  with  the  refusal  of  Germany,  through  the  mouth  of  Dr.  Schacht  (president  of  the  Reichsbank),  to  pay  interest  or  any  proportion  of  interest  upon  her  debts,  includ  ing  the  Dawes  and  Young  loans.  This  step  amounts  to  repudiation.  The  requests,  polite  enough  in  all  conscience,  of  the  British  and  French  Governments  for  further  information  on  the  situation,  are  declared  by  the  Nazi  organs  to  be.  'mere  bluff'  and  the  principal  Nazi  newspaper  states  that,  should  England  take  any  active  steps  against  Germany  in  regard  to  these  debts,  Germany  would  'retaliate  against  the  whole  British  Empire  which  sells  considerably  more  to  Germany  than  it  buys  from  her'.  'Whilst  it  may  be  true  that  Germany  buys  more  from  the  British  Empire  than  that  Empire  buys  from  her,  the  thought  might  occur  even  to  the  Nazi  intelligence  that  it  is  no  benefit  to  sell  to  a  country  which  does  not  pay.  It  is  better  to  be  without  the  business.  .  Ever  since  the  AVar  period,  German  national  finance  has  been  a  stumbling  block  to  Europe.  After  the  inflation  period  the  Dawes  loan  was  floated,  for  the  purpose  of  putting  Germany  upon  her  financial  feet  and  restoring  her  currency.  When  the  final  reparation  settlement  was  arrived  at,  the  Young  loan  was  floated  to  assist  in  that  settlement.  Germany  had  the  money  but  reparations  have  been  done  away  with.  At  every  turn  Germany  has  scored,  and  she  proposed  to  crown  her  victories  of  the  past  by  an  open  repudiation  of  her  international  obligations.  It  may  or  it  may  not  be  surprising  that  Nazi  finance  should  in  the  end  come  down  to  the  same  level  as  the  finance  of  the  Bolshevists,  to  whom  the  Nazi  spirit  is  alleged  to  be  so  opposed.  The  affair  may  prove  to  be  a  further  lesson,  and  it  may  be  hoped  a  lesson  which  will  sink  home,  to  those  who  for  so  long  have  argued  that  the  reconstruction  of  world  trade  can  only  be,  or  chiefly  be,  accomplished  by  the  financial  reconstruction  of  Europe.  Hun  dreds  of  millions  of  pounds  have  been  lent  to  the  countries  of  Central  Europe  for  reconstruction  purposes,  with  the  consequence  that,  with  one  exception  (Czechoslovakia),  they  are  all  to-day  as  bankrupt  as  they  ever  were.",1934-05-01T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/161051821,"When Germany, a month ago, placed an embargo upon the import of wool, amongst other raw materials, it was noted here that this situation had been arrived at as part of a German programme to bring pressure to bear upon her",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article161051821?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1930-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1939-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"Daily Commercial News and Shipping List (Sydney, NSW : 1891 - 1954)",135.3385467529297,very relevant

161143323,GERMAN AFFAIRS.,"  GERMAN  AFFAIRS.   On  Sunday  last  a  plebiscite  was  held  in  Germany,  by  which  it  was  supposedly  intended  that  the  people  of  Ger  -  many  should  Have  an  opportunity  of  expressing  their  opinion  of  the  amalgamation  of  the  two  offices  of  President  of  the  Republic  and  Chancellor  in  the  person  of  Adolf  Hitler,  the  Chancellor.   Previous  to  the  plebiscite  an  intensive  campaign  had  been  under  taken  by  microphone,  through  the  press,  by  every  sort  of  emotional  excitement,  to  ensure  that  the  result  of  the  voting  should  be  in  the  affirmative.  Considering  the  circumstances  of  government  in  Germany  to-day,  there  could  never  have  been  much  doubt  upon  this  point,  because  it  is  an  acknowledged  rule  of  Nazidom,  expressed  many  times  by  Herren  Hitler,  Goering  and  Goebbels,  that  there  can  be  no  opposition,  no  other  way  of  thinking  in  Germany  to  that  which  these  gentlemen  dictate.  The  result  of  the  plebiscite  was  in  the  affirmative,  and  it  has  even  been  described  as  a  victorious  result.  Upon  examining  the  figures,  however,  it  is  quite  clear  that  the  Nazi  Government  is  by  no  means  as  popular  as  might  appear  from  the  figures.  About  10  per  cent,  of  the  population  had  the  courage  to  vote  'No,'  whilst  almost  as  many  again  either  spoilt  their  ballot  papers  or  did  not  vote  at  all.  It  is  to  be  assumed  that  those  who  spoilt  their  papers  and  did  not  vote  were  definitely  opposed  to  the  present  regime  but  had  not  got  the  courage  to  say  so.  After  all,  the  present  circumstances  of  Germany  are  particularly  unhappy.  The  country  is  on  the  verge  of  bankruptcy;  the  restric  tions  upon  food,  clothing  and  raw  materials  are  reminiscent  of  war  time  measures:  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  is  deeply  dissatisfied,  and  the  Protestant  Church  not  less  so  ;  the  great  Industrialists  view  with  horror  the  swing  of  Nazi  economic  doctrine  towards  Com  munism  ;  even  in  the  ranks  of  Hitlerdom  there  is  certainly  great  unrest.  Foreign  observers  in  the  country  regard  the  situation  internally  with  considerable  apprehension.  The  events  of  June  30,  when  a  number  of  Storm  Troopers  were  shot  out  of  hand,  when  General  von  Schleicher  and  his  wife  were  assassinated,  and  an  unknown  number  of  persons  disposed  of,  have  left  a  very  sour  impression  in  Germany  as  to  the  future.  The  re  ception  accorded  to  the  Chancellor,  when  he  addressed  the  Reichstag  a  fortnight  after  those  events,  was  cool  in  the  extreme.  The  per  sonal  accounts  of  eye  witnesses  are  now  available  in  Australia,  and  confirm  in  every  detail  and  strengthen  the  observations  which  were  cabled  to  this  country  at  that  time.  The  position  has  been  summed  up  as  representing  the  end  of  Nazism  as  it  has  been  in  the  past,  and  the  beginning  of  its  end  altogether.  The  internal  position  in  Germany  is  of  the  first  importance,  not  only  to  Germany,  but  to  the  rest  of  the  world,  because,  whatever  happens  in  that  country  must  seriously  affect  affairs  in  other  parts  of  the  world,  particularly  the  present  stage  of  economic  recovery.  This  has  been  seen  in  Australia  by  the  fall  in  the  wool  market,  fol  lowing  upon  the  embargo  laid  by  Germany  upon  the  import  of  raw  material.  It  is  the  continued  uncertainty  as  to  what  will  eventuate  in  that  country  which  still  dominates  the  wool  market,  and  indeed,  all  other  markets  for  raw  materials.  It  is  not  until  Germany  becomes  stabilised  under  one  form  of  Government  or  another,  and  until  what  Shakespeare  calls  'the  alarums  and  excursions'  in  that  country  cease,  and  its  unhappy  people  can  settle  down  to  internal  peace  and  internal  development,  that  the  general  situation  can  right  itself.",1934-08-23T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/161143323,"On Sunday last a plebiscite was held in Germany, by which it was supposedly intended that the people of Germany should have an opportunity of expressing their opinion of the amalgamation of the two offices of President",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article161143323?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1930-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1939-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"Daily Commercial News and Shipping List (Sydney, NSW : 1891 - 1954)",135.3385467529297,very relevant

215094470,GERMAN COURTSHIP.,"  GERMAN  COURTSHIP.   Courtship  in  Germany  is  a  very  business-like  affair.  All  the  love-  making  is  done  in  public.  Even  a  hichlv-born  en  traced  counle  walk   about  arm-in-arm  or  hand-in-hand.  They  embrace  in  public,  he  sits  with  his  arm  round  her  waist  at  dinner,  and  everyone  encourages  such  ver-  flowing  evidences  of  affection.  The  German,  however,  who  made  love  so  madly  before  marriage  allows  his  ardour  to  cool  after  a  few  years  of  wedded  life  are  passed.  Army  officers  are  regarded  as  ideal  husbands-for  well-to-do  girls,  but  the  father-in-law  generally  has  to  pay  the  soldier's  debts.  A  youth  may  be  only  a  penniless  lieutenant,  with  nothing  to  recommend  him  but  his  debts  and  his  uniform;  but,  provided  he  comes  of  a  good  family,  he  can  propose  for  any  daughter,  no  matter  how  well-to-  do  or  exalted  a  personage  her  father  'may  be.

22923371,German Defeat.,"  German  Defeat.   THE  former  Crown  Prince  Rupprecht  of  Bavaria,  commander  of  the  German  sixth  army  on  the  Western  Front,  has  recently  published,  in  some-   what  condensed  form,  his  wartime  diary.  Bupprecht  was  a  competent  soldier,  not  a  merely  decorative  army  chief  like  the  Crown  Prince  of  Prussia,  writes  a  Berlin  correspondent.  He  exercised  actual  command,  and  was  re  garded  with  respect  by  the  real  di  rectors  of  German  operations,  the  men  In  control  of  the  General  Staff,  and  the  High  Command.  He  also  possessed  an  independence  of  judgment  which  enabled  him  to  see  the  errors  committed  by  his  superiors  and  to  sense  the  German  military  failure  at  a  time  when  the  highest  military  authorities  were  still  deceiv  ing  the  public  with  predictions  of  vic  ton  and  a  profitable  peace.  An  article  in  the  ""Vossische  Zeitung""  notes  and  comments  on  some  of  the  diary's  more  striking  entries.  It  says:  '""More  than  a  year  ahead  I  saw  coming  everything  that  did  come/  he  wrote  on  November  1,  1018,  to  his  father,  to  whom  during  the  war  he  had  imparted  his  hopes  and  cares  in  a  long  series  of  very  detailed  letters.  He  recognised  the  causes  of  the  break  down—the  declining  strength  of  an  overtaxed  and  decimated  army,  and  the  numerical  superiority  of  the  Allies,  due  to  decisive  American  reinforce  ments.  In  these  frank  letters-to  his  father  there  is  no  talk  of  a  'stab  in  the  back.'  ""On  the  contrary.  The  bow  was  bent  so  far  that  it  finally  broke/  he  wrote  on  September  30.  1918.  Already,  on  June  1.  1918,  when  Ludendorff  stlH  hoped  to  break  through  the  French  front  with  his  offensive,  the  Crown  Prince  advised  peace  in  a  report  to  Chancellor  Hertling:  Now  we  have  trumps  in  our  hand—later  we  -shall  hare  none.'  ""He  was  not  deceived  by  the  initial  successes  of  the  Boissons-Rheinvs  of  fensive  in  July,  1918:  'In  the  horn*  Press  these  last  few  days  the  battle*  near  Rheims  and  Boiasons  are  pictured  as  great  German  successes,  on  the  of  fensive  and  on  the  defensive.  I  iind  such  deception  of  public  opinion  in  excusable/  ""On  September  4  he  saw  thai  only  an  immediate  peace  proposal  could  stave  off  the  catastrophe.  Re  wrote:  'The  general  situation  Is  more  critical  than  ever.  The  battalions  of  the  regi  ments  coming  out  of  battle  often  num  ber  between  40  and  4O?  men.  It  is  also  to  be  feared  that  under  some  cir  cumstances  the  enemy  may  succeed  within  a  few  days  in  breaking  thepugh  our  front.  An  immediate  peace  pro  posal—even  with  great  sacrifices—is  urgently  required/  ""On  September  30  he  saw  that  all  was  lost,  although,  as  he  stated  out,  'every  one  who  expresses  hia  opinion  is  regarded  as  a  slacker  and  pessimist  a  weakling,  and  an  inferior  person/  He  said:  ~  •  .

It  is  urgently  necessary  to  con  clude  peace  at  any  price,  for  we  are  as  good  as  defenceless/  ""  The  Crown  Prlace  also  criticises  both  the  Weimar  and  fee  Bismarckian  con  stitutions  for  giving  too  much  power  to  Prussia.  He  says  on  this  point:  •*With  all  the  North's  services  it  cannot  be  denied  that  under  its  polit  ical  leaderahin  Germany  suffered  the  greatest  political  catastrophe  in  her  history.""",1930-01-02T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/22923371,"THE former Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, commander of the German sixth army on the Western Front, has recently published, in",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22923371?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1930-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1939-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The Queenslander (Brisbane, Qld. : 1866 - 1939)",135.3385467529297,very relevant

251753684,GERMAN BARTER.,"  GERMAN  BARTER.   The  German  barter  system  should  have  a  solid  check  in  the  guarantees  given  to  European  countries  by  England  and  France.  Direct  barter  of  certain  definite  bulk  lines  needed  for  immediate  consumption  in  the  countries  concerned  in  the  interchange  may  prove  practical*  but  the  German  policy  is  loaded  against  the  buyer  of  ^ei'man  goods.  .  •  In  many  instances  where  payment  y  Germany  has  been  by  various  lines,  the  quality,  modernity  and  other  features  of  the  articles  have  been  found  sadly  wanting  and  in  South  America  and  Eastern  Europe,  the  sharp  practices  of  German  exporters  have  led'to  the  cancellation  of  the  agreements.  There  u,  however,  a  more  serious  factor  for  consideration.  In  most  instances  German  purchases  are  of  primary  products.  Having  secured  supplies  of  such  goods  the  German  authorities  instead,  of  taking  the  goods  into  home  consumption,  have  thrown  them  on  to.certain  markets  points,  evidently  with  the  double  object  of  breaking  the  market  standard  and  at  the  same  time  securing  forr  eign  credits.  This  has  been  done  repeatedly  with  butter  purchased  from  neighboring  countries  and  then  resold  to  their  detriment.  It  could  easily  be  the  same  with  wool,  and  in  this  direction  South  African  woolgrowers  are  becoming  nervous  as  to  the  real  merit  of  the  agreement  which  gives  Germany  wool  at  a  world  price,  and  helps  to  destroy  other  purchasers  trading  power  ,by  the  distribution  of  bartered  manufactured  goods  in  which  the  political  aims  of  the  Nazi  authorities  have   jnore  consideration  than  the  welfare  •  ^  concerned  in  production.  The  entry  of  Dictatorism  into  marketing,  a  natural  sequence  to  Govern  ment  interference  in  trade  and  production,  has  had  startling  lessons.  German  manipulation  of  produce  and  other  like  markets  has  been  disastrous,  but  how  much  heavy  fluctuaitons  in  stocks  and  bonds  have  been  due  to  premeditated  war  scares,  will  make  a  pretty  story  of  gangsterism  cn  a  national  scale  when  the  full  hiscriminality  against  suppliers  of  goods  tory  of  the  last  few  years  is  revealed.

30087625,GERMAN DEMOCRACY,"  GERMAN  DEMOCRACY   ANYTHING  like  an'intelligent   criticism  ;  of  the  speech  of  Herr  Hitler  is  impossible  on  a  first  reading,  and  without  some  guidance  of  opinion  from  those;  who  are  more  closely  in  touch  with  conditions.  Just  as  a  first  thought,  we  are  inclined  to  say  that  there  is  much  fuss  and  fury,  and  very  little  of  solid  fact  or  real-  ity.  '  Throughout  the  speech  we  seem  to  hear  the  clashing  of  arms,  but  with  a  mediaeval  flavour,  as  though  some  ancient  chivalry  under  the  stress  of  emotion  were   banging  swords  and  maces  against  shields  for'the  especial  purpose  of  terrifying  their  enemies.  But  the  initial  remarks  regarding  German  democracy  sound  (strangely  in  Australian  ears.  Herr  Hitler  be-  gan  by  declaring  that  Germany  has  a  democratic  constitution,   which  is  responsible  to  the  people  through  a  single  Deputy,  elected  by  the  votes  of  the  people.  This  indi  vidual  is  expected  to.  harmon-  ise  his  actions  with  his  conscience   to  God,  and  his  duty  to  the  people   he  serves.  We  think  that  no  one   in  this  period  of.  experience  will  doubt  the  sincerity  of  Herr  Hitler  nor  the  reality  of  his  belief  in  his  mission.  But  that  very  sincerity  makes  him  the  more  dangerous.  Democracy  as  represented  by  the  consolidation  of  full  power  of.  Government  in  one  man,  with-an  appointed  bureaucracy  to  carry  out  his  orders,  does  not  seem  to  fit  in  with  any  ideas  gathered  either  from  the  past  or  the  pre-  sent.  And!  a  democrat  who  is  an  autocrat,  and  who  while  passion-  ately  declaring  the  futility  of  war,  organises  his  people  on  a  war  basis,  must  be  regarded  as  a  men-  ace.  Perhaps  Herr  Hitler's  de-  finition^  German  democracy  may  stimulate  thoughtful  people  in  other  countries  to  consider  whether,  in  practice,  there  is  such  a  thing.",1935-05-23T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/30087625,"ANYTHING like an intelligent criticism of the speech of Herr Hitler is impossible on a first reading, and without some",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article30087625?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1930-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1939-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The Mercury (Hobart, Tas. : 1860 - 1954)",135.3385467529297,very relevant

52363951,GERMAN MINES,"  GERMAN  MINES  GERMANY'S  RUTHLESS  and  in  discriminate  use  of  mines  is  plainly  intended  to  frighten  all  ship  ping  away  from  Britain.  Since  she  has  no  friends  to  lose  she  has  thrown  all  the  laws  of  warfare  overboard  and  is  prepared  to  sink  the  ships  of  any  nation  in  a  desperate  attempt  to  blockade  Britain  as  she  herself  is  blockaded.  It  is  a  campaign  of  ter  rorism  that  will  serve  only  to  hasten  the  alignment  of  nations  in  active  opposition  to  Germany  in  this  war.  Apart  from  the  way  in  which  the  mines  are  being  used,  the  terrific  explosive  content  of  some  of  them  is  proof  of  Germany's  hope  of  in  timidating  all  shipping  movement  in  English  waters.  The  charges  are  far  stronger  than  necessary  merely  to  sink  a  ship.  The  vessels  that  strike  them  are  blown  almost  to  pieces,  making  heavy  loss  of  civilian  life  in  evitable.  The  sinking  of  the  Japanese  liner,  Terekuni  Maru,  will  cause  great  anger  and  perturbation  in  Japan,  and  may  have  a  profound  effect  upon  Japanese  foreign  policy  at  a  time  when  Nippon's  international  rela  tions  are  in  a  state  of  flux.  It  will  be  useless  for  Germany  to  blame  Mr.  Winston  Churchill  for  the  mining  of  this  vessel.  Surprisingly  enough,  the  Nazis  have  now  admitted  that  their  mines  have  been  responsible  for  the  loss  of  the  neutral  vessels  sunk  dur  ing  the  last  few  days.  ""Germany  re  grets  it  if  the  results  are  rather  sad  for  neutrals,  but  can  do  nothing  about  it,""  said  a  broadcast  from  Hamburg.  Perhaps  she  would  not  have  been  so  frank  had  she  known  that  within  a  few  hours  a  crack  Jap  anese  liner  was  to  be  sent  to  the  bottom  of  the  sea  by  her  agency.  Japan  will  consider  this  disaster  in  conjunction  with  the  report  that  Germany  has  bought  from  Russia  twenty  submarines  for  operations  in  the  Far  East  and  the  Indian  Ocpan.  The  risk  of  total  war  being  extended  by  Germany  to  these  seas  cannot  be  dismissed.  So  far  as  Britain  is  con  cerned,  it  is  extremely  unlikely  that  the  new  German  frightfulness  will  be  successful  in  cutting  her  off  from  the  world  and  starving  her  into  submis  sion.

11075522,German Universities,"  German  Universities   Sir,  -  Would  you  permit  me  to  make  comment  on  Sir  James  Barrett's  letter,  which  appeared  in  Saturday's  magazine  section  under  the  heading  ""German  Uni-  versities.""  The  writer  states  that  2,000  non-Aryans  and  others  have  been  dis-  missed  from'the  German  universities  be-  cause  their  outlook  did  not  commend  Itself  to  the  German  Government,  and  hopes  this  is  due  only  to  a  passing  emotional  phase.  To  this  I  would  like  to  add  that  not  only  the  universities,  but  the  Press,  cinema,  theatre,  musical  world,  publishing  houses,  art  world,  schools,  and  professions  -in  short,  all  spheres  which  are  able  to  influence  human  thought  in  a  large  way  -have  been  relieved  of  the  influence  of  people  who  were  known  to  have  used  their  positions  to  spread  the  communistic  ideol-  ogy  by  methods  that  were  so  ably  exposed  in  a  series  of  articles  in  your  paper  quite  recently.  This  was  done  in  order  that  Ger-  man  culture  would  be  able  to  advance  within  the  framework  and  in  the  direction  laid  down  by  Goethe,  Schiller,  Lessing,  &c.,  whom  Sir  James  Barrett  mentions  so  wistfully.  The  German  Government  holds  that  a  people's  culture  derives  its  direc-  tion  from  its  past,  and  can  only  develop  in  the  direction  laid  down  by  that  past;  and  that  alien  influences  can  only  destroy   it.   -  Yours,  &c,  F.

136698154,German Figures,"  German  Figures  The  figures  for  the  so-called  Ger  man  election  are  surely  astounding.  Allowing  for  the  possibility  that  the  Nazi  appeal  caught  the  imagination  of  the  German  people  to  a  much  greater  extent  than  on  the  occasion  of  the  election  for  the  Roichstag  in  March  last,  it  is  impossible  to  accept  the  suggestion  contained  in  the  figures  that  the  people,  forgetful  of  former  divisions,  have  pooled  their  strength  for  the  purpose  of  supporting  Herr  Hitler  and  his  friends.  The  more  rea  sonable.  view  is  that.  though  the  appeal  to  unity  sounded  emotional  depths  to  a  greater  extent  than  for  merly,  fear  operated  to  prevent  a  true  expression  of  opinion.  For  the  Nazis  are  known  In  their  own  country  as  the  upholders  of  force.  and  of  any  method  to  secure  what  they  regard  as  the  welfare  of  the  State.  Taking  the  referendum.  the  question  was-""Do  ""you,  German  man,  and  you,  German  ""woman,  approve  of  the  policy  of  your  ""Government?  Are  you  ready  to  ye  ""cognise  it  as  the  expression  of  your  ""own  views,  and  will  you  solemnly  ""pledge  yourself  to  it?""  The  question  is  important  in  considering  the  figures,  for  only  2.055,000  voted  in  the  nega  tive  compared  with  43,464,000  in  the  affirmative.  If  the  vote  is  a  true  reflex  of  opinion,  the  world  is  told  that  7.000,000  Social  Democrats  and  4.000,000  Communists  who  were  against  the  Nazis  last  March  have  been.  converted  by  a  brutal  terrorism  into  enthusiastic  admiration  for  the  Nazi  regime.  The  relatives  and  friends  of  thousands  of  men  who  have  become  outcasts.  and  thousands  of  others  who  have  been  thrown  into  concentration  camps,  are  so  grateful  to  the  Government  that  they  went  en  thuslastically  to  the  polls  to  testify  their  opinions.  It  is  certainly  difficult  to  believe.  However.  Hitler  has  secur  ed  his  triumph.

193606295,GERMAN CREDITS.,"  GERMAN  CREDITS.   Sir,  —  Under  date  of  12/2/37,  writing  from  Hobart,  Tasmania,  and  duly  pub  lished  in  the  ""Daily  Examiner,""  Mr.  William  Ager  states.—  It  is  reported  that  Germany  has  a  rlpht.  nf  £90(100  000  nf  loan  at  short  call.   mostly  on  England,  and  .which  she  states  she  is  unable  to  pay.  It  is  also-  rumored  that  efforts  are  being  made  to  make  the  United  States  receptive  towards  another  loan  to  Ger  many,  such  loan  to  be  made  jointly  by  British,  French,  and  United  States  in  terests.  It  must  be  clearly,  understood  that  when  a  nation  secures  a  loan  from  another  nation  no  money  is  inter  changed.  Goods  or  materials  are  taken  to  the  amount  of  the  credits  extended.  :  Since  1918  credits  have  been  extend  ed  to  Germany  through  the  control  re  serve  franking  system  in  America  and  England,  and  Germany  as  a  conse  quence  has  become  so  completely  or  ganised  in  air,  field  and  naval  arma  ments  that  she  is  able  to  ignore  the  League  of  Nations,  defy  the  world  and  .hop  over  and  win  unopposed  conquests,  and  the  prevaricating,  subtle,  under  mining  diplomacy  stills  prevails  to  draw  further  goods  and  materials  to  the  strorighold.  Blatantly  denying  the  responsibility  for  the  last  war,  she  may  yet  blame  Britain  for  the  next  be  cause  the  world  is  not  willing  to  hand  over  mandated  territories  upon  demand.  It  must  be  clearly  ,  understood  that  the  world  is  not  dealing  with  German  people,  who  are  a  very  fine  race.  A  gang  of  fiends  who  are  organising  world  wide  mass  murder,  hide  behind  all  this  vast  camouflage  and  the  German  people  are  .  hungry  because  their  resources,  energy  and  hundreds  of  millions  Of  pounds  of  their  wealth  are  absorbed  annually  in  the  maintenance  and  fur  ther  development  of  the  mighty  war  organisation.  The  bluff  about  being  unable  to  pay  has  continued  all  too  long.  The  people  of  the  world  in  general,  and  Great  Bri  tain  in  particular,  should  rub  their  sleepy  eyes  and  realise  what  is  hap  pening  by  the  international  money  sys  tem  controlling  and  extending  credits.  When  Great  Britain  needs  armaments  for  defence,  made  necessary  by  such  gigantic  and,  advanced  preparations  in  Germany,  she  is  told  by  the  same  inter  national  money  monopoly  that  she  must  provide  her  defences  from  taxation.  It  is  to  be  regretted  that  there  is  an  absence  of  such  writers  on  national  and  international  affairs.  In  substantiation  of  Mr.  Ager's  con  tribution,  I  quote  a  broadcast  speeclFby  Dr.  Goddard  on  Sunday  night,  February  14,  on  international  affairs  from  2BL  recorded  in  ""The  Book  of  Time.""  Per  chance  many  listeners  are  aware  that  Dr.  Goddard  is  an  authority  on  inter  national  affairs.  He  said:  Germany  in  her  race  for  armaments  is  depriving  every  individual  population  of  £160  of  food  yearly.  -From  time  to  time  the  cables  flash  across  the  world  some  startling  arith  metic,  but  unfortunately  the  country  press  only  receives  a  brevis  .  account  -in  a  condensed  or  mutilated  'form.  Since   1914  to  1927  it  has  been  my  hobby  to  devote  my  leisure  to  national  and  in  ternational  affairs  published  monthly  in  the  magazine  ""Life.""  Some  newspaper  writers,  -of  course,  if  only  by  force,  of  habit,  reflect  and  exaggerate  the  mood  ;  of  the  moment,  and  they  change  with  the  mood.  They  are  not  so  closely  in  touch  with  actual  facts.  .DISTRACTED  GERMANY.  Germany,  to  the  hasty  observer,  might  well  seem  to  be  on  the  point  of  bank  ruptcy.  In  1923  Sir  Phillip  Gibbs,  thei  noted  war  correspondent,  visited  .  Ger-  1  many,  and  gave  a  graphic  story  of  what:  he  saw  there.  He  said,  however,  that  with  the  mark  at  5uo,000,000  to  the  Eng  lish  pound  note  there  was  still  no  out  ward  sign  of  poverty  or  rum  in  Ger  many.""  He  could  not  make  head  or  cail  of  this  wild  melodrama  of  paper  money  which,  fell  .In  value  by  tens:,  of  millions  between  the  ""soup  and  the  xoffee  of  his  midday  meal.  It  seemed  to  make  ""no  difference  ""  tOtKe  people.  They  still  thronged  the  restaurants  and  cabarets  and  though  .prices  rose.  auto  matically  as  the  exchange  falls,  thev  .eemed  to  get  enough  of  this  f\ntastic  currency  to  pay  f  0  c.  their  pleasure  as  well  as  their  necessity.  ""But,""  he  added,  ""this  is  the  way  in  which  mod  ern  civilisation  '  masks  for  a  time  the  decay  and  the  disease  which  are  eating  at  its  vitals  like  a  spreading  cancer.""  Even  to  the  cool  Australian  mind  looking  across  the  sea  at  the  distrac  tions  and  tumult  of  what  we  call  ""Ger  many,""  it  seems  .that.it  offers  a  spec  tacle  of  ruin  such  as  Europe  has  not  seen  since  the  Forty  Years'  ""Vvar.  Yet  the  ruin  is  not  brought  on  Germany  by   the  sword  of  its  enemies,  but  by  the  insane  policy  of  its  own  rulers.  They  were  too  proud  to  accept  defeat,  and  have  tried  to  evade;  its  just  conse  quences.  The  German  currency  has  been  deliberately  ruined—  and  ruined  on  a  scale  unknown;.in  history—  as  part  of  the  plan  to  make  the  payment  of  the  reparations  for  the  wrongs  done  to  the  nations  it  attacked.  We  have  but  to  contrast  how  Germany  treated  France  in  1870.  For  six  months'  war  she  exacted  a  fine  of  £200,000,000  —  and  Alsace-Lorraine!  And  her  troops  were  quartered  on  France  -till  this  penalty  was  paid.  .Or  we  have  but  to  contrast  the  policy  since  defeat  adopted  by  Austria  with  that  of  Germany  to  realise  that  Germany  has.  brought'  upon  itself  the  suffering  which  now  almost  theatens  it  with  destruction.  Austria  accepted  its  defeat,  and  has  honestly  paid,  as  far  as  possible  the  price  of  defeat!  As  a  result,  it  has  the  sympathy  and  help  of  Europe,  and  is  back  towards  prosper  ity.  It  is  cruel,  perhaps,  to  say  that  '  Germany  has  tried  to  cheat  its  creditors,  but  has  it  honestly  tried'  to  pay  them?  THE  DANCE  OF  THE  GERMAN  MARK.  Only  a  mathematician  accustomed  to  deal  with  what-  may  be  called  astrono  mical  magnitudes  can  keep  touch  with  the  performances  of  the  German  mark;  but  a  record  of  its  gyrations  during,  say,  a  single  fortnight,  may  be  attempt  ed.  The  week  before  the  issue  of  the  Baldwin-Curzon  note,  the  German  mark  was  rated  at  4,000,000  to  the  dollar,  a'rid  under  the  influence  of  the  British  letter   it  went  up  a  few  points  and  reached  2.500,000  to  the  dollar.  Then  came  the  blast  of  Poincai-e's  reply,  with  its  twin  document  from  Brussels,  and  the  mark  tumbled  down  with  meteoric  speed  till  it  touched  about  7,000,000;:  and  then  8,000,000  to  the  dollar.  On.:  September  5,  1923,  it  had  gone  almost  completely  out  of  sight,  as  it  descended  to  20,000,000  to  the  dollar,  and  continued  its  downward  flight  till  it  actually  reached  44,000,000  to  the  dollar.  The  mark,  it  must  be  remembered,  .before  the  Great  War,  was  equal  in  I  value  to  the  British  shilling;  at  the  point  reached  it  was  equal  to  a  forty-  millionth  part  of  a  dollar,  a  value  which  only  a  microscope  of  the  highest  magni  fying  power  could  do  so  much  as  see.  It  was  expected  then  to  fall  tc  100,  LOU,  000  to  the  dollar"",  which  is  about  zero,  and  at  that  stage  ""not  only  cities,  towns  and  Villages,  but  State  railways,  banks,  manufacturing  co-operations,  business  houses  and  even  .  individuals  have  been  printing  and  issuing  their  own  flat  money  during  tnc  I  shortage.""  Now,  how  can  civilised  existence  continue  under  such  con  ditions?  And  since  then  the  mark  has  fallen  to  yet  lower  depths!—  I  am,  etc.,   PETER  KNIGHT.  -",1937-06-18T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/193606295,"Sir,--Under date of 12237, writing from Hobart, Tasmania, and duly published in the ""Daily Examiner,"" Mr. William Ager states.--",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article193606295?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1930-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1939-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"Daily Examiner (Grafton, NSW : 1915 - 1954)",135.32171630859375,very relevant

24699236,GERMAN DEMANDS,"  GERMAN  DEMANDS   HISTORIANS  in  years  yet.  to|   come,  when  they  will  be  in  a  position  to  look  back,  and  make  a  fair-  ly  unbiassed  review  of  the  War,  and  its  consequences,  may  conclude  that  the  Treaty  of  Versailles  can  rank  with  the  Treaty  of  Vienna  a  century  earlier,  as  indicating  a  total  absence  of  under-  standing.  No  doubt  a  great  part  of  the  muddle  was  due  to  the  insistence  of  President  Wilson  that  the  adjust-  ment  of  conditions  must  be  delayed  until  his  own  special,  fad  was  dealt  with.  Certainly  that  insistence  was  responsible  for  the  hasty  creation  of  the  League  of  Nations,  but  since  America  at  once  repudiated  the  under-  takings  of  her  President,  nothing  was  gained.  The  history  of  the  world  since  has  been  a  sad  one.  Some  of  the  clauses  of  the  Treaty  of  Versailles  have  been  ignored,  and  the  financial  clauses  of  this  and  other  treaties  have  been  changed,  and  changed  again,  un-  til  they  are  unrecognisable.  And  now  Germany  is  in  a  condition  of  practical  revolt  against  the  conditions  of  the  Treaty  limiting  her  right  to  arma-  ments.  For  this  spirit,  we  arc  sorry  to  say,  France  has  some  responsibility.  In  spite  of  the  fact  that  Germany  has  been  left  practically  helpless  for  ag-  gression,  France  refuses  every  sugges-  tion  for  a  substantial  reduction  of  armaments.  Perhaps  this  consistent  refusal,  and  the  examples  of  chauvin-  ism,  are  more  directed  against  Italy,  but,  in  order  to  avoid  complications,  Germany  is  held  up  as  the  potential  enemy.  There  has  been  much  adverse  comment  as  to  the  failure  of  Great  Britain,  through  the  League  of  Na-  tions,  or  otherwise,  to  bring  about  a  settlement.  This  criticism  is  not  just.  Great  Britain  has,  during  and  since  the  War,  pulled  so  many  chestnuts  out  of  the  fire  for  others,  all  of  whom  were  ungrateful,  thal  suggestions  of  further  burning  of  fingers  in  the  cause  of  al-  truism  are  not  welcomed.

This  means  a  serious  interruption  to  an  old  established  trade.  But  the  manufac-  turers  are  faced  with  a  difficult  posi-  tion.  Already  there  is  a  great  deal  of  money  owing  for  goods  supplied,  and  the  German  Government  has  not  only  authorised  but  has  practically  com-  pelled  repudiation  of  the  debts.  It  must  be  noted  that  this  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  public  debt,  whether  owed  to  Governments  or  to  private  in-  dividuals  or  companies.  It  is  purely  a  matter  of  private  obligations  incurred  as  between  trading  concerns.  German  merchants  have  bought,  at  prices  fixed  by  mutual  consent,  quantities  of  cotton  goods  from  manufacturers  in  Lanca-  shire,  who  have  paid  for  the  raw  ma-  terial,  the  wages  of  the  persons  em-  ployed,  and  other  incidental  charges  Their  customers  are  men  with  whom   they  have  had  dealings  for  many  years,  j  and  there  has  not  been  any  suggestion  of  doubt  as  to  their  ability  and  willing-  ness  to  meet  their  obligations.  Now  these  are  set  on  one  side,  and  it  has  not  been  possible  even  lo  secure  the  pro-  mise  of  an  arrangement  for  future  payment.  In  the  circumstances  there  can  be  no  other  course  than  to  refuse  further  business.  But  the  position  is  extremely  serious.

251676616,GERMAN SHEEP.,"  GERMAN  SHEEP.   Germany's  flocks  of  sheep  have  been  increased  by  a  third  in  the  past  three  years  in  the  great  drive  for  economic  self-sufficiency.  An  official  census  shows  that  Germany  now  has  4,400,000  sheep,  which  is  1,100,000  more  than  at  the  time  of  the  1932  census.

How  far  Germany  has  progressed  along  the  road  to  general  self-sufficiency  has  been  shown  by  recent  official  figures,  which  showed  that  the  value  of  food  imports  had  declined  from  3,900,000,000  marks  (£325,000,000)  in  1929  to  1,100,000,000  marks  (£91,700,-  1  000)  in  1934.

Coincidental  with  this  pessimistic  outburst  from  a  statesman  who  is  the  very  antithesis  of  a  militarist  or  alarmist,  interesting  information  has  been  published  concerning  the  actual  significance  of  the  state  ment  made  by  the  German  Presi  dent-Chancellor  (Herr  Hitler)  to  the  British  Foreign  Secretary  (Sir  John  Simon)  during  the  Berlin  conversa  tions  recently,  that  Germany  had  already  achieved  air  parity  with  Britain.  This  was  perhaps  gener  ally  assumed  to  mean  that  the  Ger  man  establishment  of  military  air  craft  was  equal  to  that  maintained  in  the  British  Isles-a  total  of  about  480  machines,  but  it  is  now  statged  on  apparently  relialle  authority  that'  Germ?rny's  strength  in  the  air  is  equivalent  to  that  of  the  British  Empire,  or  a  total  of  about  1020  first-line  'planes,  thus  placing  Britain  herself  in  an  in  feriority  of  more  than  two  to  oe.  During  the  Great  War  Germany  was  the  initiator  and  principal  ex  nonent  of  the  policy  of  air  fright  fulness  against  the  civilian  popula  tions  of  the  countries  of  her  enemies,  and  even  after  nearly  twenty  years  there  are  still  a  sufficient  number  of  Britons.  particularly  Londoners,  alive,  who  well  renimember  the  Ger  man  air  raids,  when  bombls  were  dronpnd  ruthlessly  on  the  great  metropolis,  with  no  distinction  be  tween  strictly  military  and  ourely  nonr-military  obiectives,  for  the  dis  b.losuire  of  Germany's  preient   superiority  to  produce  an  irrestist  able  demand  for  muc'h  greater  ac  :eleratiou  of  Britain's  aerial  arman  rnment  than  was  provided  for  in  the  recently  passed  Estimates.  The  German  demand  for  a  navy  ,:iuivalent  to  that  of  France,  or  approximately  one-third  the  size  of  the  British  Navy,  will  also  be  very  hard  for  Britain  to  accept,  for  in  addition  to  the  fact  that  as  the  whole  of  Germany's  war-time  naval  strength  was  surrendered  at  the  close  of  the  war  and  then  scuttled  at  Scapa  Flow,  thus  ensuring  that  any  new  German  navy  will  consist  entirely  of  the  most  modern  ships,  whereas  most  of  the  units  of  the  British  Navy  date  from  war  or  pre  war  years.  Britain's  naval  craft  are  so  distributed  over  the  seven  seas  that  the  force  sought  by  Ger  many  would  approximately  give  her  Iarity  with  Britain  in  the  North  Sea.  As  Germany  has  no  colonies,  and  a  comparatively  short  coast  line,  it  is  difficult  to  see  that  she  has  any  legitimate  claim  to  a  navy  as  big  as  that  of  France  with  her  extended  coastline  on  two  oceans  and  her  somewhat  spread-eagled  African  colonies.  When  Britain's  sufferings  at  the  hands  of  German  aircraft  and  sub  marines  during  the  Great  War  are  rmemembered,  it  will  not  be  surpris  ing,  in  view  of  these  disquieting  trends  of  German  rearmament,  if  the  Prime  Minister's  declaration  about  Germany  having  ""broken  the  road  to  peace""  meats  with  a  re  sponse  from  the  British  public  which  will  materially  stiffen  Britain's  attitude  towards  Europe's  pressing  security  problem.  Germany  appears  to  have  a  strong  case  for  a  substan  tial  measure  of  rearmnament,  but  failing  an  early  and  authoritative  secaling  down  of  her  present  demands  in  that  direction,  she  will  have  her-'  self  to  blame  if  she  finds  practically  her.

37071201,GERMAN DIPLOMACY,"  GERMAN  DIPLOMACY   Sir,  —  In  his  letter  on  the  causes  of  the  Great  War  Mr.  Jones  has  made  many  inaccurate  statements.  He  said,  for  instance,  that  the  Kaiser  aban   doned  the  policy  of  Bismark,  which  stood  for  European  concentration,  friendly  alliance,  and  prevention  by  diplomacy  of  alliances  between  other  countries.  On  the  contrary,  ihe  Bis  markian  policy  was  one  of  deliberate  and  ruthless  conquest.  His  famous  de  claration  was  that  the  destinies  of  Germany  were  to  be  worked  out  not  by  notes  and  speeches,  but  by  blood  and  iron.  His  three  successful  wars  in  six  years  earned  for  him  the  name  of  'The  Iron  Chancellor.'  Mr.  Jones  says  that  during  the  Spanish-American  war,  the  Kaiser  ap  proached  England  with  regard  to  op  posing  the  United  States,  and  that  England  stood  by  America.  But  Mr.  Usher,  in  his  book,  asserts  that  the  Spanish-American  war  was  instigated  by  England  in  order  to  prevent  Ger  many  from  acquiring  the  Spanish  colonies.  Both  statements  may  be  wrong.  Again,  Mr.  Jones  says  that  during  the  Boer  War,  Germany  made  over  tures  to  France  and  Russia,  suggest  ing  combined  action  against  England,  but  that  they  refused.  According  lo  historians  Russia  and  France  were  pre  pared  to  intervene  on  behalf  of  the  Boer  Republic  if  Germany  would  join,  but  she  refused  to  do  so.  In  1899  the  London  'Daily  Mail'  was  full  of  praise  of  Germany.  The  Kaiser  was  hailed  as  'a  '  friend  in  need,  and  a  gallant  gentleman  whose  word  is  bet  ter  than  many  another's  bond.1',  Mr.  Jones  refers  to  General  Bern  hardi's  book  as  proof  of  Germany's  guilt,  A  book,  exactly  parallel  to  General  Bernhardi's,  entitled  'L'Of-   fensive  Contre  Allemagne'  has  been  written  in  France  by  Colonel  Boucher.  Another  correspondent,  Mr.  Watson,  mentioned  the  Agadir  incident,  m  1911  French  and  Spanish  troops  had  all  leir  spheres  marked  out  for  them  by  '  the  secret  articles  in  the  Anglo-French  agreement.  France  took  the  lead  in  threatening  war.  Germany  sent  'The  Panther'  to  Agadir  as  a  protest.  Why  Mr.  Watson  should  see  in  the  building  of  the  Constantinople  —  Bagdad  railway  more  evidence  of  ihe  German  qloven  loof  when  the  whole  world  is  hunt  ing  for  railway  concessions  is  beyond  my  comprehension.—  I  am,  sir,  &c,  Morningside.  -  F.

German  fairy  tales  are  full  of  obsolete  words  and  archaic  constructions  that  may  be  attractive  for  the  educated  German  reader,  but  are  difficult  for  even  well-advanced  students.  Moreover,  German  style  has  changed  greatly  since  the  time  of  the  Brothers  Grimm.

263079241,GERMAN JEWS AND GERMAN CULTURE,"  GERMAN  JEWS  AND   GERMAN  CULTURE   By  ARNO  WITTEN   The  Jews  ai’e  endowed  with  sur  prising  spiritual  gifts.  There  is  one  domain  of  their  own,  the  pro  vince  of  religious  and  moral  ethics  where  the  great  deeds  of  this  small  people  have  shaped  the  human  history  of  millenniums.  The  spreading  of  the  idea  of  the  one,  spiritual  and  •  invisible  God,  the  creation  of  the  Bible,  the  mo  rals  and  teachings  of  Moses,  Christ,  Spinoza  and  Marx  have  in  fluenced  mankind  more  than  the  art  of  the  Egyptians,  the  geogra  phical  explorings  of  the#  Vikings,  the  laws  of  the  Romans,’the  war  deeds  of  Alexander  or  of  Ghengis   Khan.   Although  a  people  that  has  formed  the  shape  and  idea  of  human  life  throughout  the  civili  sed  world  has  certainly  fulfilled  ■the  task  which  history  has  laid  •  on  it  the  Jews  have  over  that  pro  •duced  miracles  also  in  the  sphere  •  of  general  human  culture.  And  .specially  so  in  Germany,  the  coun  try  that  to-day  denies  them  every  valuable  quality  of  mind  and  soul.   Their  contributions  to  art  and  .science  are  almost  inconceivable.  The  more  so  if  we  consider  that   they  have  been  kept  away  from  any  collaboration  with,  and  even  from  the  admission  to,  almost  any  form  of  cultural  life  since  ,  time   immemorial.  No  one  would  expect  people  who  had  been  forced  to  live  in  open  country  and  to  whom  the  doors  have  suddenly  been  opened  to  rush  into  the  building,  to  pull  down  immediately  the  old  walls  and  to  erect  better  ones.  They  must  first  find  out  their  way  in  the  new  surroundings  and  to  accomodate  themselves.  (It  is  •only  a  little  more  than  a  centi.ry  •since  the  Jews  have  been  permit  ted  to  join  the  European  life  with  equal  rights—and  that  indeed  only  formally,  not  even  practic  ally—-and  this  permission  has  al  ready  been  revoked  again,  It  is  instructive  to  remember  that  cruel  fact.  We  sometimes  forget  it).   Besides  that,  there  is  another  reason  why  all  those  achievements  must  be  classified  in  the  highest  ranks  of  human  successes.  For  also  after  their  admission  to  the  European  dinner-table'  they  were  not  served  the  same  dishes.  as  their  fellow-beings.  If  the  Jews  made  the  most  valuable  •  contribu  tions  to  the  welfare  of  the  civi  lised  society  it  was  not  certain  at  all  that  the  .  contributions  were  appreciated  as  they  infallibly  would  have  been  with  their  fellow  scientists  and  fellow-artists.  If  the  Jews  received  any.  rewards  of  their  endeavours  at  all  then  there  was  almost  always  connected  with  it  some  humiliatins.  Although  they  may  have  been  winners  of  the  Nobel-prize  or  they  may  have  gained  the  admiration  of  the  whole  civilised  world,'  as  for  in  stance  Einstein,  who  changed  the  human  outlook  on  eternity,  or  Freud  who  opened  new  perspec  tives  of  men’s  cognition,  they  were  not  regarded  as  digniifed  enough  to  become  ordinary  tea  chers  at  the  university.   But  in  spite  of  those  handicaps,  which  proved  only  that  anti-Jew  ish  feelings  never  had  practically  ceased  to  exist,  the  Jewish  fight  ers  for  the  development  of  man  kind  gave  the  best  of  their  hearts  for  the  benefit  of  the  human  so  ciety,  imbued  with  the  ardent  de  sire  to  further  the  progress  of  the  human  race.  And  it  Is  almost  in  credible  how  marvellously  they  succeeded  in  nearly  every  cultural  province.   At  first  thought  it  may  seem  not  worth  the  while  to  remember  what  the  Jews  have  achieved  in  Germany  and  for  Germany.  In  deed  the  wheels  of  history  will  not  be  turned  into  any  other  direction  by  the  statement  how  much  the  Jews  have  added  to  the  benefit  of  German  name  and  German  fame.  But  it  will  buttress  the  proud  and  the  certain  feeling  of  the  Jews  themselves  that  one  day  when  the  waves  of  hatred  will  have  been  .  calmed  down  Jewish  accomplishments  will  be  recognis  ed  again  and  that  the  world  will  give  the  Jews  that  place,  in  the  council  of  peoples  for  which  they   .  are  entitled  to  claim.   When  the  Jews  in  the  beginning  of  the  19th  century  were—ac  least  formally—admitted  as  equal  to  the  community  of  free  men  in  Germany,  it  was  as  if  a  bulwark  had  been  broken  down  and  the  water  dammed  up  behind  it  had  fallen  like  a  torrent  into  the  open  land.  So  powerful  was  the  mental  energy  that  became  free  and  ru  shed  down  into  every  district  of  spiritual  activity.  Impossible  to  count  down  every  Jew  who  has  added  stones  to  the  edifice  of  Ger  man  art  and  science.  We  can  give  only  a  few  names  out  of  thou  sands.  But  we  can  appraise  the  real  significance  of  that  powerful,  stream  of  spii’itual  fructification  only  if  we  consider  that  the  Jews  comprising  but  1  per  cent  of  the  German  population  at  once  took  part  in  the  building  up  of  the  cul  tural  life  by  contributors  out  numbering  10  or  even  20  times  their  actual  proportion  of  the  po  pulation.  An  example  may  make  it  clear  how  this  miraculous  fact  turned  out  to  be  of  almost  in  credible  .  effects:  The  Jews  for  in  stance  brought  forth  9  remarkable  composers  in  a  little  more  than  one  century;  the  Germans,  in  or  der  to  keep  pace  should  have  had  to  muster  900  (!)  equivalent  ta  lents  or  take  another  example:  About  25  per  cent  of  the  German  Nobel-prize  winners  were  Jews,  equal  to  five  .times  more  than  their  proportion.  And  so  it/-  was  in  nearly  every  district  of  cultural   life.   At  the  beginning  of  that  “Pe-  ,  riod  of  Enlightenment”,  stands  the  venerable  figure  of  the  poor  hunch  backed  office  clerk  and  great  philosopher  Moses  Mendelssohn,  the  friend  of  Lessing.  He  was  still  deep-rooted  in  Jewish  feelings  and  it  was  but  in  his  adult  years  that   he  learnt  to  write  German.  Pro  found  was  his  influence  on  Ger  man  philosophy.  (The  fate  of  his  children  is  significant;  it  shows  how  quickly  by  the  way  of  assi  milation  large  and  valuable  parts  of  Jewry  have  been  absorbed  by  the  German  people:  Two  of  his  sons,  baptized,  became  the  found  ers’  of  one  of  most  famous  Euro  pean  Banks.  His  daughter,  also  baptised,  was  renowned  for  her  literary  salon  and  played  an  im  portant  part  in  the  history  of  Ger  man  literature.  His  grandson  Felix  Mendelssohn-Bartholdy,  baptised,  was  one  of  the  greatest  German  composers.  And  many  of  his  des  cendents  are  reputed  as  artists  and  scientists).  Besides  Mendel  ssohn  there  were  many  more  Jew  ish  philosophers  as  for  instance  Salomon  Maimon,  Otto  Liebmann,  Herman  Cohen,  Gustav  ^  Simmel,  Gustav  Landauer  etc.  Although,  they  were  not  the  great  lonely  stars  they  influenced  largely  thoughts  and  ideas  in  Germany.   In  the  discipline  of  Physics,  Mathematics  and  Physics  near  to  the  province  of  Philosophy,  scores  of  Jews  excelled.  The  one  Einstein  would  suffice  to  procure  the  Jews  a  place  of  honour  in  the  history  of  Science.  Only  the  coming  cen  turies  can  judge  fully  his  import  ance.  But  he  seems  to  be  a  genius  the  like  of  whom  mankind  pro  duces  only  every  some  centuries  to  be  placed  in  line  with  men  like  Ptolemy,  Galileo,  Giordano  Bruno  and  Newton.  And  there  are  many  others  whose  names  can  keep  the  field  also  besides  Einstein.  Hertz  (theory  .  of  electric  waves),  J.  Frank  (theory  of  atoms),  David  sohn  (electro  motor),  Marcus  (petrol  motor),  Berliner  (micro  phone),  Haber  (nitrogen),  Frank  (Kali),  Caro  (dyes),  Willstaetter  (Chlorophyl),  Bayer,  the  son  of  a  Jewish  mother  and  the  founder  of  the'  mighty  German  Dye  concern  (indigo)  and  practically  thou  sands  of  famous  names  more.   Jews  have  always  been  prepon  derant  physicians  and  that  may  partly  explain  the  fact  that  there  was  nearly  no  inventive  medical  achievement  without  Jewish  guid   ance  or  at  least  Jewish  assistance.   It  is  almost  impossible  an  under  taking  to  enumerate  the  names  of  the  countless  medical  pioneers  and  only  a  few  ones  may  therefore  be  mentioned  who  acquired  wide  pub  lic  fame.  So  Meyerhof  (transfor   mation  of  energy),  Zunz  (physio  logy),  Ehrlich  (Salvarsan),  Was  sermann  and  Morgenroth  (both  diagnosis  of  syphilis,  Freud  (psychoanalysis),  Adler  (indivi  dual  psychology),  Minkowsky  (diabetes),  Boas  (stomach  di  seases),  Zondeck  (internal  di  seases),  Asehheim  (pregnancy  diagnosis)  etc.   ,  But  how  much  soever  all  these  contributions  have  added  to  the  famous  reputation  of  German  cul  ture  the  public  in  general  knew  and  appreciated  better  the  Jews,  who  worked  in  the  sphere  of  the  arts.   In  the  first  line  it  was  the  Jew  ish  musicians  who,  even  in  the   land  of  music  proper”  attracted   the  eyes  or  rather  the  ears  of  their  contemporaries.  There  •  are  the  composers  Mendelssohn,  Mey  ei’beer,  Offenbach,  Moscheles,  Ru  binstein,  Joachim,  Mahler,  Schoen  berg,  Korngold,  there  are  the  con  ducted  Walter,  Klemperer,  Klei  ber,  there  are  the  countless  prac  titioning  musicians'  of  world-wide  fame  like  Schnabel,  Horowitz,  Ser  kin,  Hubermann,  Kreisler,  Morini,  Tauber  and  scores  of  them  more.   In  the  art  of  painting  it  was  Liebermann,  Israels,  Lesser  Ury,  Chagall,  Feinger,  Marees  (a  half  Jew)  etc.  who  helped  to  develop  German  artistic  reputation.  That  seems  to  be  indeed  a  very  surpris  ing  fact.  For  since  the  Jews,  pre   (Continued  on  page  6)   GERMAN  JEWS  AND  GERMAN  CULTURE   (Continued  from  page  4)   vented  by  religious  prohibitions,  had  never  excelled  in  the  field  of  painting  it  was  all  the  more  mir  aculous  that  they  could  hold  their  own  without  any  existing  artistic   tradition.   Always  have  the  Jews  been  bear  ers  of  a  deep  inner  conscience  and  masters  of  the  word.  Since  the  days  of  the  Prophets  they  have  been  the  proclaimed  and  propa  gators  of  teachings,  doctrines  and  convictions.  That  may  be  the  ex  planation  of  the  immense  part  played  by  Jews  in  the  German  literature.  The  way  leading  from  Heinrich  Heine  to  Stephan  Zweig  is  short  in  time  but  overcrowded  by  writing,  composing,  teaching  and  admonishing  Jews:  Boeme  and  Weininger,  Wassermann  and  Werfel,  Kaffka  and  Heimann,  Schnitzler  and  Hofmannsthal,  Bu  ber  and  Mombert,  Toller  and  Weissi,  Brod  and  Arnold  Zweig,  Doeblin  and  Beer-Hoffmann  are  only  a  few  names  casually  picked  out  of  the  innumerable  spiritual  Jews  who  have  influenced  the  thoughts  and  feelings  of  the  Ger  man  people.   It  is  practically  impossible  even  if  the  limited  space  would  not  prohibit  it—to  mention  every  do   main  where  the  Jews  had  a  share  in  the  shaping  of  German  culture.  Industry  and  economicsi,  sociology  and  agriculture,  film  and  theatre  dance  and  architecture,  journal  istics  and  playwriting,  charity  and   art-donations  were  but  a  few  ones  of  the  vast  provinces  of  Jewish   collaboration.   How  is  it  possible  that  in  spite  of  all  this  cultural  work  done  by  Jews  the  terrible  outbursts  of  cruelty  against  the  German  Jews  could  happen  ?  Probably  because  the  people  did  not  know  how  great   the  share  of  the  Jews-  in  all  those  cultural  achievements  had  been.   For  however  magnificent  the  Jewish  accomplishments  were  they  did  not  reach  the  bulk  of  the  people.  The  ideas  of  the  Jewish  writers'  were  too  elaborate,  too  high-brow,  to  be  understood  by  the  masses.  They  became  the  spi  ritual  food  of  the  intelligentsia  with  the  exception  of  Heine  whose   poems  are  recited  and  sung  by  the  whole  of  Germany,  .  but  .  mostly  without  any  knowledge  who  wrote  those  deeply  touching  songs.  And  again  the  composers  although  some  of  thefn  being  pacemakers  of  new  musical  ways  did  not  pene  trate  into  the  people’s  hearts,  be  side  Mendelssohn  whose  songs  went  straight  to  the  people’s  feel  ings.  And  even  men  who  achieved  the  most  practical  successes  like  Haber  who  saved  Germany  from  losing  the  world  war  in  its  first  year,  or  Ehrlich  who  released  the  world  from  one  of  its  deadliest  plagues,  were  not  popular  because  the  simple-minded  maxi,  could  not  conceive  their  complicated  con  structive  work.   Shall  we  wonder  about  it?  No,  for  not  even  the  Jewish  ^masses  knew  it.  Even  now  after  the  last  years  of  Jewish  persecution  and  reawakening  of  Jewish  conscious  ness  a  French  Jew  with  whom  I  conversed  recently  had  no  idea  that  Bergson  and  Andre  Maurois   were  Jews  and  Anatole  France  half  of  Jewish  parentage.   Must  we  therefore  assume  that  all  the  cultural  work  done  by  Jews  has  been  in  vain?  Certainly  not.  Material  values  can  be  lost,  money,  houses,  diamonds  can  be  destroyed  but  spiritual  values  that  have  been  produced  remain..  Books  which  have  been  printed  can  be  burnt  but  their  contents  cannot  be  burned.  Heads  can  be  cut  off.but  thoughts  which  they  had  spoken  out,  the  songs  which  have  been  sung,  cannot  been  drowned,  smoth  ered,  hanged.  The  cultural  achive  ments  the  Jews  have  produced  in  Germany  will  be  remain  alive  and  there  will  be  again  a  time  of  peace  when  all  that  Einstein  and  Freud,  Mendelssohn  and  Heine  have  thought,  said,  written  and  sung,  will  again  be  heard,  read  and  sung,  and  when  again  will  be  thought  of  with  deep  and  kind  feelings  of  thankfulness  those  men  who  have  served  the  progress  of  man  with  the  best  of  their  lives.   But  something  more  will  come  out  again  of  the  marvellous  riches  of  Jewish  spirit.  Those  riches  which  have  survived  the  centuries   of  prosecution  will  remain  in  the  same  way  alive  in  spite  df  the  new  pains  that  have  come  down  over  Jewry.  The  men  who  have  pro  duced  all  those  miracles  of  their  spirits  have  had  to  go  again  on  their  new  travels  throughout  the  world.  They  had  to  leave  behind  them  their  fortunes,  their  money,  even  their  clothes.  But  they  have  taken  along  with  thentselves  their  unbroken  spirit.  That  spirit  wher  ever  the  Jews  will  be  driven  out   and  wherever  they  ‘  will  settle  afresh  will  fructify  again  mankind  for  the  benefit  of  the  human  race  and  to  the  honour  of  the  Jewish   name.",1942-07-10T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/263079241,"The Jews are endowed with surprising spiritual gifts.

261593214,GERMAN JEWS AND GERMAN CULTURE,"  GERMAN  JEWS  AND   GERMAN  CULTURE   By  ARNO  WITTEN   rne  Jews  are  endowed  with  sur   prising  spiritual  gifts.  There  is  one  domain  of  their  own,  the  pro  vince  of  religious  and  moral-  otnics  where  the  great  deeds  of  this  small  people  have  shaped  the  diuihari  history  of  millenniums.  The  spreading  of  the  idea  of  the  (dne,'.'spiritual  '  and  invisible  God,  the  creation  of  the  Bible,  the  mo  rals  and  teachings  of  Moses,  'Christ,;  Spinoza  and  Marx  have  in  fluenced  mankind  more  than  the   of  the  Egyptians,  the  geogra  phical  explorings  of  the  Vikings,  the  laws  of  .  the  Romans,  the  war  deeds  of  Alexander  or  of  Ghengis  Khan;  ,  ,   •  Although  a  people  that  .  has  formed  the  shape  and  idea  of  human  life  throughout  the  civili  sed  world  has  certainly  fulfilled  the  task  which  history  has  laid  on  it  the  Jews  have  over  that  pro  duced  miracles  also  in  the  sphere  of  general  human  culture.  And  specially  so  in  Germany,  the  coun  try  that  to-day  denies  them  every  valuable  quality  of  mind  and  soul.   Their  contributions  to  art  arid  science  are  almost  inconceivable.  The,'rhore  so  if  we  consider  that   the^‘have1  been  kept  away  from  any  Collaboration  with,  and  even  from  the  admission  to,  almost  any  form  of  cultural  life  since  time   immemorial.  No.  one  would  expect  people  whxi.ihad  been  forced  to  live  in  open  country  and  to  whom  the  do,1ors.  ,have  suddenly  -  been  opened  to  rush  into  the  building,  to  piill'  down  immediately  the  old   wall's  and  to  erect  better  ones.   They  must  first.,find  out  their  way  in  the  new  surroundings  and  to  accomodate  themselves.  (It  is  only  a  little  more  than  a  century  since  the  Jews  have  been  permit  ted  to  join  the  European  life  with  equal  1  rights—and  that  indeed  only  formally,'  not  even  practic  ally_and  this  permission  has  al  ready  been  revoked  again,  It  is  instructive  to  remember  that  crpel.  fact.  We  sometimes  forget  it),...   .  Besides  that,  there  is  another;  reaspn  why  all  those,  achievements;  must  be  -classified  -in  the,  highest  ranks  of.  human  successes.  ,For  also-  after  their-,  admission  to  the  European  dinner-table  they  were   not  served  the  same  -  dishes  -as   their,  fellow-beings.  If  the  Jews  made  the  most  yalUable  contribu   tions  to:  the  welfare;  of  the  civi-  •   lised  society  it  was  not-certain  at\   'all.  that  the-  contributions  were  ;   appreciated,  as.,  -they  .infallibly;  Would  have  been  with  their  fellow,  scientists  and.  -fellow-artists.  If;  the-.Jews  received  -any  rewards  of  1  their  ,  endeavours  at  all  then  there   was  almost  always  connected  with  ;  it..  some  hu-miliatinsr  Although  ;  they  may.  have  been  winners  of  the  Nobel-prize,  or  they  may  have  gained  .  the..  admiration  of  •  :the  Whole  civilised  world,  as  for,  -in  stance-.  Einstein,  who  changed  the  luiman.  outlook  on  eternity,  or  Freud  who  opened  new  perspec  tives  j.of  men’s  cognition,  they  wore?  ,not  ^  regarded  as  .  digniifed  enough  to  become  ordinary  tea  ohers-at.  the  university.  „  •   ;  Bnt  .  in  spite  of  those  handicaps,  which,  proved  only  that  anti-Jew  ish-feelings  neyer  had  practically  Ceased  to  exist,  the  Jewish  fight  ers;  -for;;  the  develo  pm  ent  of  man  kindL-gave-iths^best  of  their  hearts  for?  tthes?  ;beneiit  j  of  t  the.'  .human  so  ciety  iimbuedowifchathh  -ardent  dess   sire  to  further,  the  progress  of  the  human  race;.  And  it  is  almost  in  er-jdiblh  hpw  hiafvellously  they  succeeded  in  nearly  every  cultural  province:   At  first  thought  it  may  seem  not  worth  the  while  to  remember  what  the  Jews  have  achieved  in  Germany  and  for  Germany.  In  deed  the  wheels  of  history  will  not  be  turned  into  any  other  direction  by  the  statement  how  much  the  Jews  have  added  to  the  benefit  of  German  name  and  German  fame.  But  it  will  buttress  the  proud  and  the  certain  feeling  of  the  Jews  themselves  that  one  day  when  the  waves  of  hatred  will  have  been  calmed  down  Jewish  accomplishments  will  be  recognis  ed  again  and  that  the  world  will  give  the  Jews  that  place  in  the  council  of  peoples  for  which  they   are  entitled  to  claim.   \Vhen  the  Jews  in  the  beginning  of  the  19  th  century  were—at  least  formally—-admitted  as  equal  to'  the  community  of  free  men  in  Germany,  it  :was  as  if  a  bulwark  had  been  broken  down  and  the   water  dammed  up  behind  it  had  fallen  like  a  torrent  into  the  open  land.  So  powerful  was  the  mental  energy  that  became  free  and  ru  shed  down  into  every  district  of  spiritual  activity.  Impossible  to  count  down  every  Jew  who  has   added  stones  to  the  edifice  of  Ger  man  art  and  science.  We  can  give  only  a  few  names  out  of  thou  sands.  But  we  can  appraise  the  real  significance  of  that  powerful  stream  of  spiritual  fructification  only  if  we  consider  that  the  Jews  comprising  but  1  per  cent  of  the  German  population  at  once  took  part  in  the  building  up  of  the  cul  tural  life  by  contributors  out  numbering  10  or  even  20  times  their  actual  proportion  of  the  po  pulation.  An  example  may  make  it  clear  how  this  miraculous  fact  turned  out  to  be  of  almost  in  credible  effects:  The  Jews  for  in  stance  brought  forth  9  remarkable  composers  in  a  little  more  than  one  century-  the  Germans,  in  or  der  to  keep  pace  should  have  had  to  muster  900  (  !  )  equivalent  ta  lents  or  take  another  example:  About  25  per  cent  of  the  German  Nobel-prize  winners  .  were  Jews,  equal  to  five  times:  more  :than  their*  proportion.'  ’And  -'  so  :  ,it  ■  was  in  nearly  every  district  of  cultural   life.-.'  !  v"".   the  beginning  of  that  “Pe  riod  of  Enlightenment”  stands  the   y^'neratde  figure  of  t.he  poor  hunch   backed  office  clerk  and  great  philosopher  .  Moses  Mendelssohn,   t^e.  friend  of  Lessing.  He  was  still   deep-rooted,  in  Jewish  feelings,  and  it  was  .but.in  his  adult  years  that  he-.:  learnt,  to  write  German.  Pro  found,  was  his  influence  ""on  Ger  man  philosophy.  (The  fate  of  his  Children  is  significant;  it'  shows  how  quickiy  by  the  way.  of  assi  milation  large  and  valuable  parts  of  Jewry  have  been  absorbed,  by  the  German  people;  Two  of  his  sons,  baptized,  became  the  found  ers  of  one  of  most  famous  Euro  pean.  Banks.  His  daughter,  .also  baptised,  was  renowned  for  her  literary  salon  and  played  an  im  portant  part  in  the  history  of  Ger  man  literature.  His  grandson  Felix  Mendelssohn-Bartholdy,  baptised,  was  one  of  the  greatest  German  composers.  And  many  of  his  des  cendents  :  are  •  reputed  as  artists   and,  scientistsi).  isesicies  ivienciei  ssohn  there  were  many  more  Jew  ish  philosophers  as  for  instance  Salomon  Maimon,  Otto  Liebmann,  Herman  Cohen,  Gustav  Simmel,  Gustav  Landauer  etc.  Although,  they  were  not  the  great  lonely  stars  they  influenced  largely  thoughts  and  ideas  in  Germany.   In  the  discipline  of  Physics,  Mathematics  and  Physics  near  to  the  province  of  Philosophy,  scores  of  Jews  excelled.  The  one  Einstein  would  suffice  to  procure  the  Jews  a  place  of  honour  in  the  history  of  Science.  Only  the  coming  cen  turies  can  judge  fully  his  import  ance.  But  he  seems  to  be  a  genius  the  like  of  whom  mankind  pro  duces  only  every  some  centuries  to  be  placed  in  line  with  men  like  Ptolemy,  Galileo,  Giordano  Bruno  and  Newton.  And  there  are  many  others  whose  names  can  keep  the  field  also  besides  Einstein.  Hertz  (theory  of  electric  waves),  J.  Frank  (theory  of  atoms),  David  sohn  (electro  motor),  Marcus  (petrol  motor),  Berliner  (micro  phone),  Haber  (nitrogen),'  Frank  (Kali),  Caro  (dyes),  Willstaetter  (Chlorophyl),  Bayer,  the  son  of  a  Jewish  mother  and  the  founder  of  the  mighty  German  Dye  concern  (indigo)  and  practically  thou   sands  of  famous  names  more.   Jews  have  always  been  prepon  derant  physicians  and  that  may  partly  explain  the  fact  that  there  was  nearly  no  inventive  medical  achievement  without  Jewish  guid  ance  or  at  least  Jewish  assistance.  It  is  almost  impossible  an  under  taking  to  enumerate  the  names  of  the  countless  medical  pioneers  and  only  a  few  ones  may  therefore  be  mentioned  who  acquired  wide  pub  lic  fame.  So  Meyerhof  (transfor  mation  of  energy),  Zunz  (physio  logy),  Ehrlich  (Salvarsan),  Was  sermann  and  Morgenroth  (both  diagnosis  of  syphilis,  Freud  (psychoanalysis),  Adler  (indivi  dual  psychology),  Minkowsky  (diabetes),  Boas  (stomach  di  seases)  ,  Zondeck  (internal  di  seases),  Aschheim  (pregnancy  diagnosis)  etc.   But  how  much  soever.  all  these  contributions  have  added  to  the  famous  reputation  of  German  cul  ture  the  public  in  general  knew  and  appreciated  better  the  Jews,  who  worked  in  the  sphere  of  the  arts.   In  the  first  line  it  was  the  Jew  ish  musicians  who,  even  in  the  land  of  music  proper,  attracted  the  eyes  or  rather  the  ears  of  their  contemporaries.  There  are  the  composers  Mendelssohn,  Mey  erbeer,  dffenbach,  Moscheles,  Ru   binstein,  Joachim,  Mahler,  Schoen  berg,  Korngold,  there  are  the  con  ducted  Walter,  Klemperer,  Klei  ber,  there  are  the  countless  prac  titioning  musicians  of  world-wide  fame  like  Schnabel,  Horowitz,  Ser  kin,  Hubermarin,  Kreisler,  Morini,  Tauber  arid  scores  of  theni  more.   In  the-  art  of  painting  it  ’  was  Lieberinarin,  Israels,  Lesser  Ury,  Chagall;  Feinger,,  Marees  (a  ,half  Jew)  etc.  who  helped  to  develop  German  artistic  reputation.  That  seems  to  be  indeed  a  very  surpris  ing  fact.  For-since  the  Jewa,  -pre  vented  by  religious  prohibitions,  had  riever  excelled  iri  the  field  ;of  painting  it  was  all  the  mrir^.ihir.,  acuious  that  they  .could  hold  their  own  without  ’any  existing1  artistic  tradition.  **  /■V   v  (Continued  6n  page  ‘t   GERMAN  JEWS  AND  GERMAN  CULTURE   (Continued  from  Front  page)   Always  have  the  Jews  been  bear  ers  of  a  deep  inner  conscience  and  masters  of  the  word.  Since  the  days  of  the  Prophets  they  have  been  the  proclaimed  and  propa  gators  of  teachings,  doctrines  and  convictions.  That  may  be  the  ex  planation  of  the  immense  part  played  by  Jews  in  the  German  literature.  The  way  leading  from  Heinrich  Heine  to  Stephan  Zweig  is  short  in  time  but  overcrowded  by  writing,  composing,  teaching  and  admonishing  Jews:  Boerne  and  Weininger,  Wassermann  and  Werfel,  Kaffka  and  Heimann,  Schnitzler  and  Hofmannsthal,  Bu  ber  and  Mombert,  Toller  and  Weiss,  Brod  and  Arnold  Zweig,  Doeblin  and  Beer-Hoffmann  are   only  a  few  names  casually  picked  out  of  the  innumerable  spiritual  Jews  who  have  influenced  the   thoughts  and  feelings  of  the  Ger  man  people.   It  is  practically  impossible  even  if  the  limited  space  would  not  prohibit  it—to  mention  every  do  main  where  the  Jews  had  a  share  in  the  shaping  of  German  culture.  Industry  and  economics:,  sociology  and  agriculture,  film  and  theatre  dance  and  architecture,  journal  istics  and  playwriting,  charity  and  art-donations  were  but  a  few  ones   of  the  vast  provinces  of  Jewish   collaboration.   How  is  it  possible  that  in  spite  of  all  this  cultural  work  done  by  Jews  the  terrible  outbursts  of  cruelty  against  the  German  Jews  could  happen  ?  Probably  because  the  people  did  not  know  how  great  the  share  of  the  Jews  in  all  those  cultural  achievements  had  been.   For  however  magnificent  the  Jewish  accomplishments  were  they  did  not  reach  the  bulk  of  the  people.  The  ideas  of  the  Jewish  writers'  were  too  elaborate,  too  high-brow,  to  be  understood  by  the  masses.  They  became  the  spi  ritual  food  of  the  intelligentsia,  with  the  exception  of  Heine  whose  poems  are  recited,  and  sung  by  the  whole  of  Germany,  but  mostly  without  any  knowledge  who  wrote  those  deeply  touching  songs.  And  again  the  composers  although  some  of  them  being  pacemakers  of  new  musical  ways  did  not  pene  trate  into  the  people’s  hearts,  be   side  Mendelssohn  whose  songs  went  straight  to  the  people’s  feel  ings.  And  even  men  who  achieved  the  most  practical  successes  like  Haber  who  saved  Germany  from   losing  the  world  war  in  its  first  I  year,  or  Ehrlich  who  released  the  world  from  one  of  its  deadliest  plagues,  were  not  popular  because  the  simple-minded  man  could  not  conceive  their  complicated  con   structive  work.   Shall  we  wonder  about  it?  No,  for  not  even  the  Jewish  masses  knew  it.  Even  now  after  the  last  years  of  Jewish  persecution  and  reawakening  of  Jewish  conscious  ness  a  French  Jew  with  whom  I  conversed  recently  had  no  idea  that  Bergson  and  Andre  Maurois  were  Jews  and  Anatole  France  half  of  Jewish  parentage.   Must  we  therefore  assume  that  all  the  cultural  work  done  by  Jews  has  been  in  vain?  Certainly  not.  Material  values  can  be  lost,  money,  houses,  diamonds  can  .be  destroyed  but  spiritual  values  that  have  been  produced  remain.  Books  which  have  been  printed  can  be  burnt  but  their  contents  cannot  be   |  burned.  Heads  can  be  cut  off  but   thoughts  which  they  had  spoken  out,  the  songs  which  have  been  sung,  cannot  been  drowned,  smoth  ered,  hanged.  The  cultural  achive  ments  the  Jews  have  produced  in.  Germany  will  be  remain  alive  and  there  will  be  again  a  time  of  peace  when  all  that  Einstein  and  Freud,  Mendelssohn  and  Heine  have  thought,  said,  written  and  sung,  will  again  be  heard,  read  and  sung,  and  when  again  will  be  thought  of  with  deep  and  kind  feelings  of  thankfulness  those  men  who  have  served  the  progress  of  man  with  the  best  of  their  lives.   But  something  more  will  come  out  again  of  the  marvellous  riches  of  Jewish  spirit.  Those  riches  which  have  survived  the  centuries  of  prosecution  will  remain  in  the  same  way  alive  in  spite  of  the  new  pains  that  have  come  down  over  Jewry.  The  men  who  have  pro  duced  all  those  miracles  of  their  spirits  have  had  to  go  again  on  their  new  travels  throughout  the  world.  They  had  to  leave  behind  them  their  fortunes,  their  money,  even  their  clothes.  But  they  have  taken  along  with  themselves  their  unbroken  spirit.  That  spirit  wher  ever  the  Jews  will  be  driven  out  and  wherever  they  will  settle  afresh  will  fructify  again  m  inkind  for  the  benefit  of  the  human  race  and  to  the  honour  of  the  Jewish   name.",1942-07-03T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/261593214,"The Jews are endowed with surprising spiritual gifts.

Here  is  the  text  of  the  German  religion   1.—The  German  has.  his  own  re  ligion,  which  flows-  like  the  living  water  of  his  own  -^perception,  .feeling  and""  thought,  and  is  rooted  .in  his  species.'.-  We  call  it  the  German  Re  ligion,  or.  the  religion  of  the  German  people,  and  understand  thereby  a  Ger   man  Faith  caressing  the  peculiarity  i  and  the  integrity  of  the  race.   2.—The  German  religion  -is  the  lorm  of  faith  appropriate  to  our  age,  which  we  Germans  would  have  today  if  it  had  been  granted  tb  us  to  have  our  native.German  religion  developed  un  disturbed  fo  the  present  time.   3.—TheGerman  of-today  requires  a  healthy  and;  natural  religion  which;  makes  him  brave,  pious  and  strong  in  the  struggle  Jor  people  and  Father  land;  such  a  religion  is  the  German  religion.  '   Comments-—What  is  a  healthy  and  natiural  religion?  is  a  religion:  without  the  phenomena  of  disease  and  degeneration.  .  To  this  Christianity  does  not  belong.  .  Christianity  is  in  deed  an  unhealthy  and  unnatural  .re  ligion.  which  is  at  an  end.  For.  it  arose  2,000  years  ago  among  sick,  ex  hausted  and  despairing  men,  who  h^d  lost,  their  belief  in  life,  ""who  had  des  pised  .-the  world,  and  who  waited""  for   the  return  of;  Christ  and  the  destruc-  j   tion  of  .  the  world.   .4.—The  German  religion  recognises  no  dogma,  for  it  is  a  religion.'   5.—The  German  religion  is  not  a  re  ligion  of  revelation  in  the  Christian  sense,  ""  it  rests  rather  upon  a  natural  revelation  ,of  the  Divine  forces  in  the  world  and  in  the  human  mind.   6.—The  German  religion  is  the  re  ligion  of  the  people.  It  has_nothing  to  do""  with  free  througlit,  atheist  pro  paganda  and  the  ^disintegration  (Zersetzung).  of  reigion.  We.  who  are  genuine  .followers  of  German  religion  talce  our  stand  on  the  basis  of  a  posi  tive  religion.   Comments:—Where  Christianity  stops,  there..our  religion,  begins.  Be   lief  in  a  personal  God,  in  revelation  ,  and  salvation  is  all  superstition,  not  religion.  The  biologically  educated  man  ,  seeks  the  solution  of  his  moral  and  religious  problems  in  the  Cosmos,   in  nature,-  and  the  world  of  reality,  in  .  blood  and  soil,  people  and  home,  na-  j   tion  and  Fatherland.  Our  religion  is   no  longer  the  International  Christ-.j   God  which  could  not  -  prevent  Ver-  'j  sailles.  *  Our  religion  isr""-what  grows  I  living  within  us>  the  great,  sacred,  glowing  desire  to  wash  away  1,000  years  of  German  sorrow,  and  make  good  the  sins  of  the  Jewish-Christian  alien  religion  against  the  German  soul.   7.—The  German  religion  is  riot  hos  tile  to  a  church.  It  seeks  a  German  church  on  the  basis  of  a  religious  people.   8.—God  is  a  moral  idea  to  which  we  are  bound  by  the  eternal  creative  force  of  nature  which  works  in  the  world  and  man.  Belief  in  another-worldly  God  is  not  of  Indo-Germanic,  but  of  Semitic  origin'.  This-kind  of  God-be  lief  is  not  a  condition  of  true  religion  and  piety   9.—In  the  lap  of  ""  the  divine,  living  world  the  knowing  being  or  mind  grows.  Mind,  is  a  natural  growth  of   the  .  world  of  reality.  It  is  not  a  finished  thing  at  the  height  of  world   development.   10.—To  God's  being  belong  will,  un  derstanding  (verstand)  and  personal  ity.  These  are,  however,  unique  in  man.  Hence  man'  is  the  place  (Ort)   of  God  in  the~  world.   -  11.—Man  is  not  God.  But  he  is  God's  birthplace.  God  exists  and  grows  in  man.  If  God  does  not  come  in  man,  He  never  comes.  Hence  the  German  religion  is  the  religion  of  high   faith  in  man.   12.—The  German  religion  recognises  no  dualism  .or  conflict-  between  body  and  soul,  any  more'than  duality  and  conflict  between  God  and  the  world,  and  God  and  man.  We  think  of  the  being,  body-soul,  as  a  natural  unity  and  entity.   Comments—""Crucify  thy  flesh,""  was  the  demand  of  the  Esthetic  Chris  tian  ethics  of  decadence,  which  over  looked  that  at  the  same,  time  the  mind  was  crucified.  For  in  a  sick  and  tor  tured  flesh""  dwells  a.  sick  or  tor  tured  mtad.;  -In  tSe  National  Socialist  State  this  dualistic  Christian  anthropo  logy  is  completely'but''of  .date.  .  Who  ever  seeks  to  weed  the  -  inferior  and  cultivate  tlie  gifted  and  tlie  best  of  our  ~  inheritance,  whoever  seeks  a  social-aristocracy,  can  be  no  longer  Christian;,  For  Christianity  is  the  re  ligious  form  of  Social  Democracy.  Both  are  international,  ""democratic  and  be  lieving-  in  human.  equality.   13.—-The  living  world  is  the  Womb  Mother  of  the  high  '  human  mind.  Knowing,  being,  and  mind  is.  the  foirtb  'of  the-All-Mother.'  The  Mother-child   thought  is  hence  the  right  indication  of  the  God-world  secret.  We  speak  in  a  modern  nature  religion  of  the""  Mind-child""  God,  who  rests  iii  the   womb  of  the  All-Mother.   14.—The  feelings  of  ""union,  holiness  and  blessedness  are  the  basic  religious  ""■feelings.  ""The  .Christian  feelings  of  sin,  guilt,  and  repentance;  are  not  re-:  ligious  feelings  at  all.  They,  are  arti  ficially  engendered  complexes  in  man.   15.—The  ethics  of  the  German  re  ligion  ""condemns  all  belief  in  inherited  sin,  as  well  as  the-  Jewish-Christian  teaching  of  a  fallen  world  and  ""man.  Such  a  teaching  is  not  only.  non-Ger  manic  and  non-German,  it  is  immoral  and  non-religious.  Whoever  preaches  this,  menaces  the  morality  of  the  people.   16.—Whoever  forgives  sin,-  sanctions  sin.

144000790,GERMAN BARBARISM,"  GERMAN  BARBARISM   With  tumors  of  peace  feelers  by  the  Germans  being  widely  circulated  in  both  hemispheres,  and  questions  arising  concerning  the  political  future  of  Germany,  It  is  timely  that  official  revela  tions  should  have  been  made  of  the  Blmost  unbelievable  barbarity  that  has  been  openly  practised  by  the  Germans  In  countries  which  their  armies  have  overrun.  Such  disclosures  will  also  serve  to  counter  any  misplaced  pity  that  may  be  felt  at  the  increasingly  heavy  bombing  of  Berlin,  nerve-centre  and  core  of  the  whole  vile  creation  of  Naddom.   The  Polish  authorities  have  already  unearthed  evidence  J'  abundance  of  the  wholesale  slaughter  of  civilians  in  that  desolate  country.  Stories  of  trainloads  of  men,  women  and  children  setting  out  for  'murder  centres,'  there  to  be  deliberately  and  ruthlessly  machine-gunned  or  forced  into  lethal  chambers  and  gassed,  have  been  told  repeatedly  by  escapees  and  others.  Such  stories  are  too  persistent  and  factual  to  be  doubted.  They  be  token  an  attitude  towards  human  life  and  suffering  that  Is  alto  gether  foreign  to  British  civilisation—  a  foul  philosophy  of  sadism  which  appears  to  permeate  the  whole  German  nation.  Now  the  special  Russian  committee  which  is  Investigating  Nail  atrocities  in  the  Donets  Basin  has  brought  to  Ugbt  a  series  of  atrocities  equally  as  appalling,  and  entirely  In  keeping  wltn  the  German  practice  in  occupied  countries.  The  bodies  of  thou  sands  of  civilians  have  been  dug  up  from  coal  pits  and  quarries,  where  they  were  buried  by  the  Germans,  while  no  fewer  than  25,000  Russians  were  found  buried  near  the  Stalino  prisoner  of  war  camp.  Horrible  stories  of  torture  have  also  been  told,  and  the  Bnsslan  committee  has  ascertained  the  names  of  90  military  officers  and  Gestapo  officials  who  win  be  held  responsible  for  these  crUnes,  Equally  appalling  are  the  revelations  that  have  just  been  made  by  the  Inter-AIIied  Information  Committee  concerning  the  German  treatment  of  women  in  occupied  countries.  Women  nave  been  reduced  to  the  level  of  slaves.  The  Gestapo  never  hesitates  to  use  its  -expert  tortures  in  an  effort  to  make  women  lncriminate  their  menfolk,  states  the  report.  Trilling  offences  are  made  an   excuse  for  Imprisonment  and  deportation,  ana  sms  ««  abducted—a  systematic  policy  of  the  German  authorities.

259711696,GERMAN MORALE,"  GERMAN  MORALE   One  of  the  most  encouraging  developments  of  recent  weeks  has  been  tne  increasing  reference  to  the  decline  in  (iern.au  morale.  This  is  not  the  result  of  wishful  thinking,  or  even  inspired  comment  from  neutral  sources  who  might  imagine  that  we  are  anxious  to  hear  that  German  morale  was  declining.  It  comes  from  such  authoritative  a  source  as  Dr.  Josef  Goebells  himself.  Dr.  Goebells  does  not,  of  course,  refer  to  it  in  so  many  words,  but  he  does  refer  rather  significantly  to  '  temporary  weakness,""  and  he  reiterates  with  monotonous  regularity  the  fact  that  1918  ""was  a  unique  and  tragic  event  in  our  history  which  will  not,  and  cannot,  be  repeated.""  It  will  be  remembered  ""-iuuuuuicu  that  mat  in  his  nis  ast  Herr  Hitler  adopted  the  same  lone,  and  very  obviously  the  lears  of  1918  are  looming  very  large  on  the  German  canvas.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  differences  between  the  present  time  and  1918  are  not  so  very  marked.  At  this  stage  of  the  last  war,  both  Turkey  and  Bulgaria  had  been  forced  out  rather  in  the  same  way  as  Italy  has  been  forced  out  this  time.  The  crippling  defeats  which  the  German  army  is  suffering  on  the  eastern  front  were  being  emulated  on  the  western  front  of  the  last  war.  And  to  this  similarity  must  be  added  the  increasing  cost   of  the  U-boat  campaign,  which  is,  ,  lor  all  practical  purposes,  as  great  a  failure  loday  as  it  was  at  the  beginning,  of  1918.  But  there  is  another  and  very  important  difference  in  the  situation—tiie  first,  which  favours  the  United  Nations,  is  the  fact  that  Germany  is  being  iiit  far  harder  from  the  air  than  was  possible  during  the  last  war.  The  second,  winch  is  in  favour  of  Germany  is  the  fact  that  the  Nazis  have  a  much  more  stringent  and  brutal  dis-  *  lpunc  of  the  civilian  population  than  did  the  Kaiser's  Government  of  Lie  last  war.  Consequently,  u  would  be  foolish  to  anticipate  au  iitinn  diate  earl  j  collapse  of  the  Cer  mans,  although  this  is  by  no  means  impossible.  It  must  not,  however,  be  expected.  At  the  same  time  it  looks  very  much  as  though  the  German  leaders  themselves  are  not  too  hopeful.  This  constant  reiteration  of  PJLS  is  an  indication  of  how  much  it  is  preying  on  their  minds.  No  doubt,  before  the  end,  Ihe  German  people  will  de  cide  whether  they  prefer  certain  death  from  the  air—or  their  men  folks  on  the  lighting  fronts  of  Europe—or  whether  they  prefer  to  risk  death  lighting  their  greatest  enemy,  ihe  Nazi  leaders  themselves.  Very  obviously  the  position  inside  !  Germany  is  deteriorating  very  sub  stajilially,  and  the  task  ahead  o  1  the  United  Nations  now  is  to  see  that  lull  advantage  is  taken  of  this  declining  morale,  and  that  the  offensive  strength  of  the  Allies  is  used  Lo  tile  utmost  lo  smash  down  Lerinan  tyranny,  The  fighting  in  Italy  and  in  Russia  is  prov  ing  a  tremendous  dilliculty  tor  the  Germans.

47671875,GERMAN GOVERNMENT,"  GERMAN  GOVERNMENT  With  the  formation  of  Dr.  Adenauer's  right-wing  coali  tion  Government,  the  West  Gernman  Federal  Republic  has  now  been  launched  and  the  Occupation  Statute,  which  de  fines  the  rights  of  the  western  Allied  Powers  pending  the  con  clusion  of  a  peace  treaty,  has  simultaneously  come  into  force.  The  new  republic,  founded  on  the  democratic  parliamentary  principles  of  the  Bonn  Consti  tution,  is  not  yet  a  fully  sove  reign  State,  for  it  is  subject  to  discretionary  Allied  control.  Nor  is  the  structure  of  the  Re  public  complete,  for  it  has  not  been  possible  to  include  the  Russian  zone.  But,  within  those  limits,  a  self-governing  Ger?jp  State  has  been  brought  into  being  by  the  Western  Powers.  It  is  a  fateful  experiment.  The  willingness  and  capacity  of  the  German  people  to  make  a  re  presentative  parliamentary  sys  tem  work,  which  has  already  failed  once  in  the  destruction  of  the  Weimar  Republic  by  Hitler's  Nazism,  is  again  being  put  to  the  test  in  a  very  difficult  post  war  stage.  The  outcome,  politically  and  economically,  will  have  a  profound  influence  on  the  future  of  Europe  and  the  task  of  Dr.  Adenauer  as  the  first  Chancellor,  is  one  of  the  gravest  responsibility.  The  return  of  germany  to  a  proper  place  in  the  European  and  world  community  has  been  facilitated  by  the  Western  Powers.  But  there  will  be  need  for  sound  evidence  of  German  attachment  to  peaceable  demo  cratic  practice  and  of  a  genu  inely  cooperative  spirit  to  justify  the  next  step,  which  would  presumably  be  admis  sion  to  the  Council  of  Europe.  The  greatest  danger,  as  always  in  German  politics,  must  come  from  the  lack  of  any  ingrained  parliamentary  tradition  and  the  struggle  of  extremists  on  the  right  and  the  left  to  overthrow  the  moderate  democrats  and  seize  authoritarian  power.  A  stabilising  factor,  however,  is  that  the  two  major  parties-the  Christian  Democrats  in  office  and  the  Social  Democrats  in  opposition-stand  firmly  for  constitutional  and  democratic  principles.  The  Christian  Democrats,  although  the  larg  est  party  in  the  Federal  Lower  House,  have  only  139  seats  out  of  402.  Under  Dr.  Aden  auer's  leadership  they  de  clined  to  seek  a  Government  with  the  Social  Democrats  (131  seats)  because  of  deep  divisions  on  economic  policy.  Dr.  Aden  auer  therefore  looked  to  the  smaller  parties  on  his  right  and  he  has  formed  a  coalition  with  the  conservative  .  Free  Democrats  and  the  strongly  nationalist  German  Party.  It  is  a  coalition,  however,  which  has  an  extremely  narrow  ma  jority.  Dr.  Adenauer's  pro  blem,  in  which  the  Western  Powers  have  an  acute  and  ap  prehensive  interest,  will  be  to  resist  dictation  from  the  right  and  to  hold  in  check  the  re  vival  of  nationalism  which  was  so  strongly  marked  in  the  elec  tion.",1949-09-22T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/47671875,"With the formation of Dr. Adenauer's right-wing coalition Government, the West German Federal Republic has",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47671875?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1940-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1949-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The West Australian (Perth, WA : 1879 - 1954)",135.32130432128906,very relevant

261714636,GERMAN MIGRATION GERMAN MIGRATION,"  GERMAN  MIGRATION   OPPOSED  BY  E.C.A.J.  CONFERENCE   GERMAN  MIGRATION   In  his  address  about  German   migration  to  Australia,  Mr.  £in   feld  stated  that  the  Committee   of  Management  has  continued  its  representations  to  the  Gov  ernment  in  opposition  to  the   continuous  intake  of  Germans  as  favoured  migrants  to  Aus  tralia.  It  is  regretted  that  the  Government  seems  determined  to  continue.  with  this  policy,  and  it  is  distressing  to  learn  that  2638  Germans  have  been  admitted  to  Australia  in  the  first  quarter  of  1954.   I  have  learnt  that  the  Gov  ernment  expect  approximately  9000  Germans  .  who  are  to  be  skilled  artisans  to  come  to  Aus   tralia  during  the  next  twelve   months.   In  regard  to  German  migra   tion  we  had  been  told  that  no  more  than  3,000-4,000  Germans  would  be  admitted—but  accord   ing  to  the  report  the  position  has  changed,  as  the  Government  will  bring'  9,000  Germans  to  this  country.  What  are  the  plans  of  the  Committee  of  Management?  Are  you  going  to  acquiesce  or  should  we  do  something  about  this  new  situa  tion.'We  want  an  objective  as   sessment  of  the  situation  and   guidance  for  our  policy.   The  delegate  from  S.A.,  Mr.  Hines,  expressed  the  desire  that  the  immigration  of  some  unsuit   able  elements  of  other  nationali   ties  (Poles,  Lithuanians,  etc.)   should  also  be  included  in  the  orbit  of  our  attention.   Mr.  H.  B.  Newman  (N.S.W.)   defended  the  policy  pursued  by  the  Committee  of  Manage  ment  in  this  delicate  political   issue.   Mr.  Wolfensohn  referred  to   the  fact  that  inquiries  were  made  on  the  point  raised  by  Mr.  Hines,  but  no  answer  has  come  from  the  competent  authority.   An  interesting  debate  de  veloped  on  the  discrimination  inflicted  on  a  company  which  wanted  to  deal  with  $audi  Arabia  and  invoked  the   E.C.A.J.  intervention  with  the   Australian  and  British  Govern   ment  against  such  discrimina  tion.  The  prevailing  opinion  was  that  an  approach  to  the   Crown  should  be  made  only  it|.  a  matter  of  vital  policy.   Answering  Mr.  Ben  Green,   Mr.  Einfeld  stated  that  the  Committee  of  Management  was  not  idle,  but  has  repeatedly   intervened  with  the  Govern*   ment  from  September,  1953,  on  this  issue  and  it  has  finally  been  settled  by  the  combined  efforts  of  N.S.W.  and  Victoria.'   As  to  the  dissatisfaction  re,   German  migration,  Mr.  Einfeld  said  with  emphasis:  “I  d<?n’t  know  of  any  new  method  how  to  fight  German  migration!

49030551,GERMAN MIGRATION,"  GERMAN  MIGRATION  A  chronic  difficulty  in  Aus  tralia's  immigration  and  de  velopment  programme  has  been  to  obtain  a  sufficient  pro  portion  of  skilled  agricultural  workers.  This  is  an  import  ant  factor  to  be  reckoned  with  in  the  urgent  and  complex  problem  of  revitalising  food  production.  Even  if  Britain  were  not  herself  engaged  in  a  vigorous  drive  for  more  out  put  from  the  land,  the  com  petition  from  other  overseas  countries  is  such  that  Austra  lia  would  still  have  to  turn  to  Europe  for  agricultural  mi  grants.  There,  too,  post-war  rehabilitation  has  reduced  the  small  proportion  which  farm  workers  represent  in  the  pool  of  potential  migrants.  But  there  is  a  surplus  of  landless  farming  people  in  West  Germany  for  special  rea  sons  emphasised  by  the  mem  bers  of  the  West  German  Federal  Migration  Board  now  visiting  Western  Australia  on  an  exploratory  mission.  The  Commonwealth  Govern  ment's  move  towards  accept  ance  of  a  quota  of  selec  ted  Germans  under  a  negotia  ted  migration  agreement  like  that  with  Italy-gives  Australia  a  chance  to  recruit  agricultural  workers.  For  West  Germany  it  offers  some  relief  in  the  problem  of  pro  viding  for  an  influx  of  nearly  10,000,000  people  who  are  either  victims  of  Communist  expulsion  from  the  Russian  dominated  territories  or  fugi  tives  from  Communist  terror.  Nothing  but  prejudice  need  stand  in  the  way  of  working  out  an  arrangement  for  mutual  advantage.  If  we  have  to  go  outside  Britain  for  population  we  naturally  look  first  along  the  Western  European  seaboard  for  assimilable  racial  stock  most  akin  to  our  own.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  war  there  have  been  great  changes  in  Germany  and  also  in  the  Western  attitude  to  the  Ger  man  people  and  their  future  in  the  free  world.  An  at  tempt  is  being  made  to  build  up  a  friendly  and  peaceful  cooperation  and,  at  the  same  time,  circumstances  have  pro  duced  a  new  period  of  Ger  man  readiness  to  migrate.  In  South  Australia,  particularly,  there  is  experience  of  how  an  earlier  generation  of  German  settlers  showed  a  capacity  to  identify  themselves  with  the  life  and  institutions  of  their  adopted  country.  Any  German  migration  now  could  amount  to  only  a  micro  scopic  percentage  of  the  Australian  population  and,  should  any  political  or  other  undesirables  slip  through  the  screen,  they  could  always  be  sent  back  on  proof  of  subversion  or  misconduct.  There  would  be  no  need  for  costly  land  settlement  ven  tures.  Concentration  on  Ger  man  farmers  or  farm-workers  willing  to  take  agricultural  jobs-perhaps  under  some  limited  contract-would  im  pose  a  minimum  strain  on  housing.

50207781,GERMAN PROBLEMS,"  GERMAN  PROBLEMS   Despite  the  grant  of  wide  self-governing  powers  and  economic  aid  to  Western  Ger  many,  it  is  doubtless  too  much   to  expect  that  relations  be  tween  this  and  other  Euro  jpean  States  should  be  con  sistently  harmonious.  British  policy  and  British  actions  have  I  often  been  unjustly  criticised  by  the  Adenauer  Government.  Upon  Britain  has  fallen  the  brunt  of  the  attack  relating  to  the  Allied  policy  of  disman  tling  certain  German  indus  tries.  Most  of  the  industrial  plants  marked  for  demolition  were  in  the  British-controlled  zone;  and,  as  fresh  cases  of  violence  this  week  have  I  shown,  German  workers  threatened  .  with  unemploy  iment  are  inclined  to  ascribe  I  their  troubles  to  those  near  at  hand.  |j  In  the  matter  of  disman  tling,  however.  Western  Ger  Ijmany  has  not  been  treated  liwith  undue  severity  by  the  II  Allies.  In  the  past  year,  de   molitions  of  major  plants  have!  seen  curtailed.  Some  observers.!  indeed,  feel  misgivings  overj  :he  decision  to  raise  the  an  nual  ceiling  for  German  steelj  production  to  eleven  million  |  :ons.  Such  unemployment!  roubles  as  face  the  Adenauer  Government,  are  due  chiefly  :o  the  waves  of  refugees  trom  :he  cast.  Latest  official  figures  show  that  there  are  now  8,500,000  registered  (and  many  unregistered)  refugees'  in  Western  Germany,  com  pared  with  1,558,469  unem-j  ployed.  Density  of  popula-l  tion  in  the  State  having  been  increased  by  30  per  cent.,  in-i  iustry  simply  cannot  absorb!  the  labor  available.  I  Even  so,  conditions  in  Western  Germany  have  enor  mously  improved  through  the  help  of  Marshall  Aid;  and  it  is  hardly  surprising  that,  apart  from  dismantling,  there  is  now  'little  sign  of  popular  disaffection,'  but  rather  a,  feeling  that  life  is  'returning!  to  normal.'  This  internal  pro  gress  seems  to  have  raised  hopes  that  the  country  can  achieve  greater  equality  with  her  neighbors,  and  perhaps  strengthen  herself  against  threats  from  the  east.  Dr.  Adenauer,  with  his  long  ex  perience  as  administrator  of  Cologne,  has  actively  en  couraged  the  idea  of  closer  German  collaboration  with  the  French.  In  view  of  the  re  cent  clash  over  the  Saar  coal  mines,  and  the  difficulties  met  in  drafting  a  trade  agreement,  however,  it  seems  scarcely  timely  for  Dr.  Adenauer  to  propose  a  Franco-German  union.",1950-03-10T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/50207781,"Despite the grant of wide self-governing powers and economic and to Western Germany, it is doubtless too much",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50207781?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1950-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1959-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1931 - 1954)",135.33221435546875,very relevant

The  world’s  press  has  given,  over  much  space  to  comment  on  Dr.  Adenauer’s  plea  that  Ger  many  should  be  strengthened  again  to  serve  as  a  buffer  between  the  West  and  Russia.  Somewhat  less  space  to  these  important  matters  has  been  given  in  the  Australian  news  papers  where  pre-occupation  with  other  issues  has  crowded  the  German  news  out.  The  impudence  of  German  “statesmen,”  boundless  as  always,  permitted  Adenauer  to  insinuate  into  his  plea  the  suggestion  that  a  re  established  Germany  could  “avert  an  otherwise  inevitable  explosion.”  It  is  good  to  see  that  for  the  most  part  Adenauer’s  proposals  have  been  re  jected  with  contumely.  The  Christian  Science  Monitor  said  that  to  rearm  Germany  would  simply  place  in  Ger  man  hands  the  balance  of  power  in  Europe,  an  arrangement  which  might  suit  diabolical  German  plans  very  well,  but  which  would  effectively  destroy  any  prospect  of  world  peace.

49219179,GERMAN MIGRANTS,"  GERMAN  MIGRANTS  A  large  party  of  German  migrants  has  arrived  in  West  ern  Australia  and  its  members  are  bound  to  be  wondering  what  kind  of  reception  they  will  be  given  in  this  large  and  remote  part  of  the  Bri  tish  Commonwealth.  And  although  West  Australians  have  become  accustomed  to  European  migration,  doubt  less  many  of  them  will  be  a  little  curious  about  these  new  Australians  whose  homeland  has  altered  the  course  of  world  history  and  may  do  so  again.  There  need  be  no  misunder  standings.  Australia  is  not  exactly  an  earthly  paradise  but  the  Germans  who  have  come  to  our  shores  are  fortunate  people  and  we,  in  turn,  should  be  glad  to-have  them.

49267736,EAST GERMAN,"  EAST  GERMAN   HATRED  OF  REDS.   Berlin,  Wednesday:  Russian  tanks  patroled  East  Berlin  tonight,  restoring  order  after  the  two-day  riots,  which  cost  four  lives  and  left  60  people  injured.   Unrest  has  spread  to  other  East  German  cities  -^Magdeburg,  Halie,  Erfurt,  and  Leipzig-where  discontent  pt  the  actions  of  the  Communist  Govern-  ment  is  growing.   Soviet  tanks  tonight  had  sealed  all  the  main  ap-  proaches  to  East  Berlin  from  .the  West.   Five  tanks,  their  guns  pointin»  toward  West  Ber-  lin,  took  up  positions  in  Un-  ter  Den  Linden,  to  reinforce  lorry  loads  of  steel-helmeted  machine-gunners.  *   Two  anti-tank  guns  were  also  deployed  in  Unter  Den  Linden,  facing  the  British  sector  through  the  Bran-  denburg  gate.   Battalions  of  East.  Ger-  many's  barracked  police  force,  which  is  trained  and  equipped  like  an  army,  guarded  the  entrances  to  East  'Berlin  and  barred  everyone  without  an  East  Berlin  I  identity  card.   Two  of  the  four  dead  in  the  riots  were  run  over  .  by  Soviet  tanks.   A  21-years-old  man,  shot  in  front  of  an  East  German  Government  building  died  in  the  West  Berlin  Hospital.  The  fourth  man.  killed  was  a   West*  Berliner,  who  was  shot   in  the  head.   Earlier  some  40,000  angry  East  Berlin  workers  .hurling  stones,  smashing  windows,  starting  fires  and  yelling  dé  nuhciatfons  bf  the  East  Ger-  man  Communist  Leaders  marched  through  the  streets.  They  demonstrated  in  front  of  the  Government  buildings  and  party  headquarters  and  outside  the  prisons,  calling  for  the  release  of  political  prisoners.   All  German  Affair   It  had  become  an  all-Ger-  man  affair  throughout  yes-  terday,  when  the  strikers  ,  forced  the  East  German   ¡Government  to  withdraw  an  .  iprder-  to  do  more  work  for   Çkie  same  pay.  After  this  Victory  the  temper  and  size  .of  the  demonstration  grew.   It  was  directed  against  the  East  German  Govern-  ment  and,  on  the  advice  -of  ¿he  workers*  leaders,  avoided  any  attack  on  the  Soviet  jragime.   Soviet  soldiers  at  first  stood  by,  but  the  East  Ger-  man  police  were  powerless.  (Twenty  police  were  tramp-  led  down,  in  Unter  Den  Linden.   Then  thc  Russians  has-  tily  dug  in  round  the  Go-  vernment  quarter  and  or-  dered  tanks  and  armored  cars  into  action.

18201007,German Migrants,"  German  Migrants   Sir,-In  reply  to  Mr.  W.  S.  Kent  Hughes,  M.P.  (""Herald,""  Feb.  23),  I  wish  to  state  clearly  my  views  on  the  question  of  Ger   man  migration.   I  have  never  condemned,  nor  would  any  other  sane  person  con-  demn,  a  whole  race  on  account  of  the  excesses  of  a  few.  As  my  brother  surely  knows,  12  million  (some  put  the  figure  as  high  as  20  million)  in-  nocent  people  cannot,  even  with  Nazi  efficiency,  be  massacred  by  a  few;  even  so,  it  has  never  been  a  question  of  condemning  the  whole   German  race.   1  and  others  who  are  opposing  this  plan  to  bring  100,000  young  Ger-  mans  to  this  country  in  the  next  four  years,  do  so  because  they  will  be  the  ones  who  received  their  whole  education  under  Hitler-the  disastrous  effects  of  which  I  saw  as  early  as  1936  and  1937-and  so  would  be  a  threat  to  our  Australian  democracy.   I  wonder  what  Mr.  W.  S.  Kent   Hughes's  reaction  wouldj  be  if  the  proposal  was  to  bring  100,000  young  Japanese  to  this  country?   When  a  new  generation  has  arisen  in  Germany,  free  from  Hitlerism,  then  it  will  be  time  enough  to  re-  open  the  question  of  German  migra-  tion.

261411113,German Migration,"  German  Migration   Percipient  members  of  the  Australian  Jewish  community  were  not  surprised  by  the  statements  in  the  press  that  the  Minister  for  Migration  (Mr.  Holt)  had  signed  an  agreement  with  the  West  German  Government  for  the  mass  migration  of  ten  thousand  Germans  a  year.   The  sign  has  been  in  the  sky  for  a  long  time,  despite  protestations  to  the  contrary,  and  statements  suggesting  that  Australian  necessity  made  the  practical  implementation  of  a  paper  scheme  impossible  of  realisation.   Now  the  sign  is  growing  larger  than  the  warning  hand.  The  ABC  news  session  on  Wednesday]  morning  reported  Mr.  Holt  as  stating  that  he  examined  the  screening  system  in  Germany  and  he  was  very  happy  with  it,  it  was  function  ing  perfectly.  He  had  seen  the  files  on  Nazis  and  their  completeness  astonished  him.   Mr.  Holt  did  not  state  whether  the  screening  of  migrants  was  based  on  the  weeding  out  of  Nazis*  or  other  people.  It  is  one  thing  to  have  the  files,  another  to  use  them  against  Nazis.   However,  he  went  on  to  say,  or  is  reported  as  having  done  so,  that  the  Dutch  would  make  the  more  desirable  migrants.   Why,  then,  is  he  allocating  first  place  to  Germans?  The  filing  system  he  praised  so  highly  would  surely  list  only  the  outstanding  workers  for  Nazism*  the  gauleiters  and  the  smaller  fry  who  bossed  the  towns  and  villages.   This  filing  system  surely  did  not  list  all  those  Noting  people  who  had  been  taken  by  the  Nazis  and  moulded  to  Nazi  doctrine  during  their  most  impressionable  years...  people  who  are  now  of  the  eligible  age  group  to  come  here.   Nor  would  any  screening  system,  however  efficient,  be  able  to  cope  thoroughly  with  so  many  applications  that  would  involve  the  acceptance  of  ten  thousand  a  year,  and  at  least  a  token  rejection  of  a  few  besides.   What  will  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  do  now,  to  acquaint  the  general  community  with  the  dangers  involved,  and  the  need  for  constant  vigilance  if  the  demo  cratic  institutions  We  have  evolved  out  of  much  tribulation  are  to  be  transmitted  to  our  successor  generations?",1952-09-05T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/261411113,Percipient members of the Australian Jewish community were not surprised by the statements in the press that the Minister for Migration (Mr. Holt) had signed an agreement with the West German Government for the mass migration,https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article261411113?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1950-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1959-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The Sydney Jewish News (Sydney, N.S.W : 1939 - 1954)",135.26666259765625,very relevant

262240442,German Rearmament,"  German  Rearmament   The  whole  question  of  rearmament  after  1945  seems  to  be  overshadowed  by  the  chan  ges  contained  within  the  heart  of   warfare.  •   Captain  Liddell  Hart,  a  world  authority  on  military  strategy  and  tactics,  in  a  recent  article  drew  attention  to  the  futile  pre-occu  pation  with  manoeuvres  and  armies  that  con  tinues  as  though  nuclear  fission  had  never  been  harnessed  to  the  destructive  spirit.   He  emphasised  the  stupidity  of  organis  ing  Commands  and  headquarters  when  a  hydrogen  bomb  dropped  within  a  few  miles  of  the  target  and  not  necessarily  at  the  bull’s  -eye  will  lay  waste  yast  areas  through  the  explosion  and  the  resultant  fall-out  of  radio   active  material  from  the  skies.   In  the  light'  of  this,  it  may  seem  just  as  stupid  to  protest  against  German  rearmament  as  belonging  to  something  of  another  era.   We  differ  from  this  view.  With  all  sides  possessing  stock-piles  of  atom  bombs,  no  one  will  dare  to  use  them,  just  as  no  one  dared  to  use  poison  gas  or  bacterial  bombs  during  the  1939-45  war.   But  the  influence  of  the  psychological  type  now  cartooned  as  the  Prussian  officer  is  a  menace.  This  influence  is  not  confined  to  study  of  out-of-date  military  tactics.  For  decades  it  has  been  imbued  with  lust  for  power,  and  in  recent  times  it  has  thrown  in  its  lot  with  Nazism.  Hitler  may  be  dead  but  his  spirit  goes  marching  on.

We  feel  that  attention  should  be  drawn  to  the  fact  that  there  appears  to  be  an  epidemic  of  german  measles  in  Canberra  at  the  present  time,  and  we  Would  like  to  give  publicity  to'  the   harmful  effects  of  this  disease.   If  contracted  by  a  woman  in  the  first  few  months  of  her  preg  nancy,  there  is  a  definite'  risk  that  her  child  will  be  born  han   dicapped  in  one  or  more  ways.  These  include  deafness,  blind  ness,  mental  retardation  ,  and  heart  lesions,  or  a  combination  of  some  or  all  of  these.   If  a  pregnant  woman  in,  the  early  stages  comes  into  contact  with  someone  suffering  from  this  otherwise  mild  complaint,  she  can  be  given  some  protection  by  her  doctor  against  actually  developing  the  disease  herself.  The  earlier  in  pregnancy  that  the  disease  actually  develops,  the  more  serious  may  be  the  con  sequences  to  the  unborn  child.  So  we  suggest  that  all  women  who  do  contract  german  measles  and  who  may  be  pregnant   should  consult  their  doctor  im  mediately.   We  would  also  suggest  that  parents  of  children  with  german  measles  take  care  to  keep  their  children,  while  they  know  that  they  are  infected,  away.  from  public  places,  shops,  buses,..etc,  where  chance  meetings  with  pregnant  women  arc  possible.   We  have  a  hearty  respect  for  the  rubella  virus  and  the  effects  it  has  had  on  children,  and  we  hope  that  the  numbers  of  Child  ren  handicapped  by  it  will'  not  be  unnecessarily  increased'  by  ignorance  or  apathy  towards-  it.

The  party,  never  was  a  unified  group,  it  was  de  fined  by  what  its  members  were  against.  no  less  than  by  what  they  were  for.   The  N.D.P.  made  particular  headway  dur  ing  the  uncertainties  which  '  arose  out  of  the  crisis  inside  the  coalition  and  ruling  party,  and  from  what  many  considered  excessive  com  pliance  towards  the  United  States.   The  new  coalition  government,  which  ;  gives  every  appearance  of  governing,  and  has   adopted  a  firm  foreign  policy,  is  believed  by  many  observers  to  have  won  back  much  of  the  public  confidence  its  predecessor  had  lost.   As  a  result  the  N.D.P.  itself  faces  a  .  dilemma.   Should  it  try.  to  win  support  by  adopting  an  even  more  extreme  stance,  and  thereby  risk  alienating  potential  support  and  even  provoking  a  ban?  *   Or  should  it  try  to  modify  its  extreme  appearance  in  order  to  attract  more  support  from  conservatives,  from  small  farmers  who  are  suffering  from  a  decline  in  protectionism,  and.  from  the  small  shokkeeper  and  business  man  who  may  be  doing  badly  or  feel  that  he  is  over-taxed?   This,  issue  has  split  the  N.D.P.  with  the  moderates  suffering  a  defeat.  If  the  result  is  to  produce  a  smaller  and  even  more  violently  extreme  group,  all  concerned  will  need  to  re  appraise  their  attitude.  Will  the  new  party  be   more  dangerous  or  le^p  so?   Will  the  weight  of  considerations  for  or  I  against  banning  be  altered?  Where  will  the   minority  and  its  supporters  go?

This  sickening  idea  is  a  true  flowering  of  the  Ger  man  soul,  of  the  kind  that  gave  us  the  death  camps  and  medical  experiments.  This  is  what  makes  German  cruelty  different  to  the  cruelty  of  other  peoples;  they  need  to  have  some  pseudo-scientific  or  psycho  logical  rationale  for  their  beastilness.

When  they  migrated  to  Poland  and  eastwards  they  took  their  language  with  them,  and  added  to  it.  It  was  known  as  Judisch  Deutch  or  Jewish  German,  and  later  as  Yiddish.   I  nave  many  times  m  my  life  wished  l  could  speak  Yiddish.  I  understand  very  little,  but  have  had  to  pretend  at  times  that  I  understand  a  lot.  On  the  other  hand,  1  know  people  who  understand  quite  a  lot  and  pretend  they  under  stand  only  a  little.   In  this  roundabout  way  I  am  gradually  getting  to  the  point  I  wanted  to  make.  My  objection  to  speeches  in  Yid  dish  is  based  on  no  grounds  other  than  simple  utilitarian  ism.  If  I  take  the  trouble,  along  with  other  non-Yiddish  speaking  Jews  (and  even  Gentiles)  of  going  along  to  a  meeting,  the  least  the  speakers  can  do  is  direct  their  re  marks  to  the  greatest  number.

If  speakers  insist  on  addressing  audiences  in  Yiddish  it  is  virtually  an  admittance  that  they  address  themselves  to  a  generation  on  the  way  out.  If  their  English  is  not  good  enough  then  they  should,  for  a  formal  speech,  arrange  for  translations  to  be  circulated  for  the  benefit  of  those  of  us  who  really  want  to  know  what  they  are  saying.

142372491,GERMAN MEASLES,"  GERMAN  MEASLES   (Contributed  by  the  N.S.W.  .  Dept.  of  Public  Health)   Popular  names  for  in  fectious  diseases  are  sometimes  misleading.  'German  Measles'  for  In  stance,  may  be  confused  with  ordinary  measles.  While  both  diseases  at  tack  children,  rubella  —  the   medical  term  for  'German  Measles'  —  can  inflict  last  ing  damage  on  babies  be  fore  they  are  born,  if  it  at  tacks  the  expectant  mother.  Although  ordinary  meas  les  appeared  in  England  as  far  back  as  1517,  rubella  was  often  mistaken  for  measles  or  scarlet  fever  un  til  1881.  Normally  a  mild  |  disease,  rubella  is  a  serious  menace  to  the  expectant  j  mother.   The  danger  to  her  is  greatest  during  the  first  four  months  of  pregnancy.  Besides  affecting  the  bear  ing  of  the  developing  child,  rubella  can  damage  the  baby's  sight,  too.  Facing  such  serious:  consequences,  each  expectant  mother  should  take  special  precau  tions  against  the  disease.  If  a  member  of  the  house  hold  develops  rubella,  the  expectant  mother  should  place  her  unborn  child's  safety  above  all  other  con  siderations.  She  must  avoid  direct  and  indirect  contacts  with  the  patient.  Infection  is  spread  by  droplet  spray  —  coughing  and  sneezing  —  as  well  as  by  freshly-soiled  towels,  handkerchiefs,  cups  and  other  articles.  Unlike  or  dinary  measles,  rubella  is  most  cominon  among  adults.  Let  a  doctor  see  the  patient;  he  can  decide  whe-  '  ther  the  trouble  is  ordinary!  measles  or  rubella.

Her  baby's  safe  ty  demands  that  such  pre  cautions  be  taken.  If  a  child  is  suffering  from  German  measles,  he  should'  be  excluded  from  school  attendance  for  three  weeks  from  the  onset  of   illness,  or  until  a  doctor  certifies  him  to  be  free  from  liability  to  convey  in  fection  —  the  minimum  period  of  exclusion  is  8  days.  Contacts  need  not  be  ex  cluded  from  school.  j  Further  information  about  Rubella  is  contained  in  a  pamphlet  available  from  the  Publicity  Officer,  Health  Department,  52  Bridge  St.,  Sydney.",1962-08-17T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/142372491,"Popular names for infections diseases are sometimes misleading.

I  and  later,  he  played  a  lead-  I  ing  part  in  the  Zionist  Feder  ation  of  Germany,  and  especi  ally  in  the  Zionist  newspaper  the  “Juedische  Rundschau.”  In  friendly  co-operation  with  Leo  Hermann,  he  wrote  article  upon  article—all  anonymous,  of  course;  as  a  foreign  Jew,  he  could  not  then  write  under  his  own  name—but  every  Zion  ist  in  Germany  was  aware  of  his  activity  and  felt  that  a  new  note  sounded  in  his  words.   I  cannot  say  that  I  always  agreed  with  the  articles  writ  ten  or  inspired  by  him.  He  was  a  faithful  adherent  of  Poalei  Zion.  The  influence  on  him  of  Borochov  and  the  very  gifted  and  original  Nach  man  Syrkin  was  clearly  notice  able.  In  “Der  Jude,”  he  wrote  on  various  topical  questions  under  the  name  R.  Zalman.   Zalman’s  connection  with  Jewish  socialism  stems  from.  Russia.  In  Germany,  he  had  some  first-rate  scholars  for   teachers.  The  studies  ,  he  be  gan  in  Leningrad  were  con  tinued  at  the  Universities  of  Freiburg,  Strasbourg  and  Ber   lin.   In  Berlin,  he  met  the  man  of  whom  he  still  rightly  says  tliat  he  was  the  greatest  Jew  ish  editor  he  ever  knew,  Dr.  Joseph  Bloch,  of  the  “Sozial  istische  MonaWhefte.”  That  man  never  wrote  a  line  him  self,  but  everything  published  in  the  ‘‘Monatshefte’’  through  out  the  years,  was  checked,  controlled  and  directed  by  him.   Zalman  knew  German  Zion  ism  in  all  its  ramifications,  and  it  seems  to  me  that  his  stay  in  Berlin  has  been  of  lasting  benefit  to  him.  He  :  lodged  at  Rose  Struck’s  pen   sion,-  together  with  his  friend  Kitain.  I  think  that  he  un  derwent  a  marked,  spiritual  development  in  those  years.

262402941,GERMAN QUESTIONS,"  GERMAN  QUESTIONS   The  Central  verein  der  Juden  in  Deutschland  (Organisation  of  Jews  in  Germany)  has  celebrated  its  tenth  anniversary.   When  the  war  ended,  it  seemed  inconceivable  that  within  such  a  short  time  a  new  Jewish  community  would  re-establish  itself  in  the  graveyard  of  its  illustrious  predecessor.   After  the  Spanish  Inquisi  tion  the  Jews  did  not  return  to  Spain  for  centuries,  and  in  the  case  of  Germany  the  in  habitants  seemed  to  be  infin  itely.  greater.   Nevertheless,  some  German  Jews  have  returned,  many  of  them  elderly  people  who  were  unable  to  strike  roots  else  where,  though  the  majority  of  the  Centreleverein  members  did  not  live  in  Germany  at  all  before  1939.   The  Germans  themselves  are  .likely  to  be  more  impres   sed  T>y  a  feeling  of  reserve  towards  them  by  Jews  rather  than  by  eagerness  to  partici  pate  in  their  country’s  fin  ancial  prosperity.   From  a  Jewish  point  of  view  the  only  justification  for  the  resumption  of  an  organ  ised  Jewish  community  in  Germany  would  be  that  it  in  sisted  upon  a  probity  of  living  that  exemplified  the  highest  traditions  and  reputation  of  Jewry.   CRITICISM   These  sentiments  should  not  be  understood  as  a  reflection  on  the  sincerity  of  the  Fed  eral  Republic  in  its  desire  to  atone.   It  is  precisely  because  these  efforts  are  recognised  that  some  recent  cases  of  judicial  lenience  bordering  on  con  criticism  must  be  made  of  donation  towards  war  crim  inals.   Statements  by  judges  that  the  killing  of  innocent  persons  by  shooting  is  neither  murder  nor  cruel,  and  their  unwil  lingness  to  accept  the  testi  mony  of  surviving  victims,  show  an  unregenrate  attitude  that  is  inconsistent  with  the  avowed  beliefs  of  Western  Germany’s  present  leaders  and  gravely  impairs  the  good  name  of  the  new  Germany   abroad.   Incidents  such  as  these  lend  added.  point  to  the  abhor  rence  which  is  widely  felt  among  the  British  public  at  large  and  among  Jews  in  par  ticular  at  the  reports  of  pos  sible  stationing  of  German  troops  in  Britain  under  NATO  arrangements.   However  logical  this  step  may  be  from  the  point  of  view  of  defence  arrangements  (though  so  far  no  convincing  reason  has  been  made  pub  lic)  logic  is  not  everything  and  sentiment  too,  must  be  taken  into  account.   While  considerations  of  se  curity  must  be  paramount,  the  misgivings  strongly  felt  by  wide  sections  of  the  Brit  ish  public  should  be  given  most  serious  consideration  by  the  Government  before  a  final  :  decision  is  taken.—  (JCFNS).  -  .  ‘",1961-01-06T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/262402941,"The Central verein der Juden in Deutschland (Organisation of Jews in Germany) has celebrated its tenth anniversary.

262397228,A GERMAN NOTEBOOK,"  A  GERMAN  NOTEBOOK   By  WILLIAM  FRANKEL   (The  first  of  too  articles).   if  lie  possesses  any  sensitivity  at  all,  a  Jew  visiting  Germany  for  the  first  time  must  undergo  an  intensely  emotional  ex  perience.   He  looks  coldly  and  almost  apprehensively  at  the  German  men  and  women  in  the  street:  were  they  among  the  persecutors?  Of  the  Germans  with  whom  he  comes  into  closer  contact,  the  Jew  won  ders:  is  the  hand  I  am  shaking  the  hand  of  one  of  the  butchers?   Naturally,  the  intensity  of  this  reaction  is  blunted  after  a  while,  but  there  remains  a  residue  very  near  the  surface  that  colours  every  moment  of  the  stay  in  Germany.   So.  of  course,  the  relation  ship  between  German  and  Jew  Is  bound  to  be  an  ab  normal  one.  Nearly  all  the  Germans  I  met  during  my  visit  felt  it  necessary  to  make  some  expression  —  from  the  eloquent  to  the  hesitant  —  of  their  sense  of  guilt  for  the  Nazi  past,  and  to  add  some  words  explaining  their  own  innocence.  Many  of  them  were,  undoubtedly,  both  truth,  ful  and  sincere,  but  yet  I  felt  that  to  some  extent  even  they  resented  being  reminded  of  something  they  would  much  rather  forget.   For  my  part,  at  each  of  these  encounters  I  could  not  avoid  a  feeling  of  some  dis  comfort  at  being  the  cause  of  shame  and  embarrassment  on  the  part  of  these  apparent,  ly  decent  Germans.  Yet  I  know  that  I  would  have  taken  amiss  the  absence  of  their  expression  of  guilt  and  of  explanation.  I  cannot  but  feel  that  this  reaction  of  German  and  Jew  will  continue  through,  out  the  lives  of  the  genera  tion  who  was  involved.   NO  TRADITION   The  present  abnormality  in  the  relationships  between  Germans  and  Jews  was,  therefore,  responsible  for  a  certain  tension  during  my  visit  But  Germany  (like  Is  rael).  is  a  country  in  which  a  great  deal  is  going  on,  and  the  interest  in  observing  this  regeneration  overlays  though  it  never  entirely  displaces,  the  I  sense  of  discomfort   Certainly,  the  Wirtschafts  wunder  —  the  miracle  of  German  economic  recovery’—■  is  all  nervading.  Shops  are  not  only  full  of  expensive  merchandise,  they  are  busily  selling  it   Innumerable  and  varied  eating  establishments  dispense  gargantuan  servings  of  whole  some  food  to  portly  diners.  New  construction,  skyscrapers,  houses,  public  buildings,  trans  form  derelict  bombed  sites.  The  men  and  women  in  the  street  are  patently  well-fed  and  well-clothed.   TENSION   This  abundant  prosperity  has  obvious  implications  for  the  prospect  for  democracy  in  Germany.  So  long  as  it  lasts,  the  German  man-in-the  street  will  be  content  with  the  Government  which  pro  vides  these  benefits.   But  Germany  has  no  tra  dition  of  democracy.  Its  citizens  have  been  condition  ed  to  respond  to  authoritar  ian  leadership.   One  of  the  many  everyday  examples,  is  the  exaggerated  difference  still  accorded  to  uniforms  and  titles.  I  have  no  doubt  that  the'  present  administration  has  a  sincere  desire  to  establish  a  soundly  based  democratic  system  in;  Germany  and  today’s  pros  perity  is  helping  to  achieve   it.   But  should  there  be  a  serious  economic  or  political  crisis,  a  new  type  of  total  litarianlsm  might  very  well  emerge.  As  a  leading  trade  unionist  put  •  it  to  me.  “I  would  not  put  my  hand  in  the  fire  for  German  democ  racy.”   It  is  a  pity  that  many  who  understand  the  fragility  of  German  democracy  try  to:   protect  it  by  over-emphasis  upon  the  fight  against  former  Nazis.  Undoubtedly  their  re  tention  in  positions  of  ap  parent  influence  exercises  a  harmful  effect  on  public  opinion.-A  new  totalitarian  ism,  however,  can  be  brought  about  by  a  wave  of  emotion  alism  and  anti-rationalism  that  may  flare  up  In  a  crisis.  The  new  right  vsdng  radical  parties  are  the  ones  to  watch.  By  diverting  energies  to  the  proscription  of  old  Nazis  (who  will  not  be  the  new  Nazis)  the  real  sources  of  the  future  danger  may  be  ignored.   EDUCATION   What,  therefore,  can  be  done  so  that  a  new  Germany  does  not  ever  again  become  militaristic,  nationalistic  and  racist?  The  education  of  the  rising  generation  in  democ  ratic  ways  and  to  a  realisa  tion  of  the  crimes  of  Nazism  is  not  a  complete  Insurance  against  another  recession  into  savagery  (nothing  is),  but  it  is  an  aspect  than  can  only  be  neglected  at  the  nation’s  peril.   I  believed  the  German  educationists  who  told  me  what  they  were  trying  to  do,  for  they  were  enlightened  and  Intelligent  people.  Ideal  cur  ricula  are  drawn  up  but  they  might  never  be  applied  in  practice  because  of  opposi  tion  by  parents  and  teachers  who,  naturally,  want  to  avoid  the  discovery  of  their  own  guilt  to  the  children.   As  the  opinions  I  heard  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  schools  programme  were  so  varied,  I  decided  to  make  my,  own  test   Without  anyone  else  being  present.  I  met  the  top  classes  of  two  schools.  One  was  a  grammar  school  and  the  average  age  of  the  boys  was  17.  They  all  had  a  fairly  good  knowledge  of  the  origins  and  rise  of  Hitlerism.  They  knew  something  about  the  causes  of  the  war  and  of  Hitler’s  invasion  of  neutral  countries  (though  they  thought  it  was  justified  in  a  “total  war”).  And  they  knew  about  the  persecution  of  the  Jews,  (the  reason  —  they  were  ter  i  ribly  rich  and  Hitler  wanted   their  money  to  start  a  war),  though  not  of  other  minor  ities.   NAZIS   Most  of  their  parents  had  been  Nazis,  but  had  explained  their  membership  to  their  children  as  having  been  due  to  economic  reasons  such  as  employment  and  getting  school  places.   In  the  second  school,  which  approximates  more  to  our  secondary  modern,  I  spoke  to  the  top  class  of  boys  who  were  about  15  year  old.  They  knew  very  little  about  Hitler  and  the  war  but  they  all  knew  the  figure  of  six  mil  lion  Jews  who  had  been  killed.  I  gathered,  however,  that  they  had  learned  this  from  television  and  not  from  school.   The  Cologne  swastika  smearing  of  December,  1959,  came  as  a  profound  shock  to  liberal  elements  in  Germany  and  the  repercussions  are  by   no  means  ended.   One  was  a  recognition  that  the  educational  programme  had  been  allowed  to  drift   almost  into  stagnation  Educ  ation  is  a  responsibility  of  the  Laender  not  the  Federal  Government  “Controversial”  issues,  like  the  teaching  of  Germany’s  past,  are  suscept  ible  to  local  pressure,  and  that  Is  one  of  the  reasons  why  more  has  not  been  done.  Ef  forts  have  been  unsuccessful  to  establish  a  Federal  Minis  try  of  Education  which  might  be  expected  to  tackle  the  sub  ject  with  greater  vigour.  Since  this  is  unlikely  to  come  about  for  political  -  and  practical  reasons,  there  ought  to  be  some  effective  system  of  school  inspection  to  ensure  that  the  syllabus  approved  bv  enlightened  Ministers  of  Education  is.  in  fact,  applied  in  lessons  and  that  teachers  do  not  plead  lack  of  time  in  stopping  the  teaching  of  Ger  man  history  at  1914.

It  is  time  he  did  so,  but  whether  it  should  be  done  in  the  public  forum  (for  example,  in  his  address  to  the  Council  of  Europe  in  Strasbourg  on  Monday)  or  in  private,  is  a  tactical  question  which  can  only  be  decidcd  on  the  spot.  He  will  have  an  opportunity  to  lay  the  foundations  for  a  bargain  with  de  Gaulle  when  he  sees  him  in  Paris  on  Tuesday.   Alternatively,  Mr  Wilson  could  first  try  to  out  manoeuvre  de  Gaulle  by  marshalling  enough  support  in  the  other  capitals,  and  among  non-Gaullists  in  France.  Could  it  be  done?  The  Five  have  all,  at  one  time  or  another,  enthusiastically  declared  support  for  British  membership.  The  wrangling  which  went  on  between  France  and  the  Five  over  the  EEC's  agricultural  policy  and  majority  voting  resulted  in  the  Five  determining  not  to  approve  de  Gaulle's  every  wish.

Then  in  1945,  the  18th  generation  experi  enced  the  collapse  of  all  that  which  a  tough,  incor  ruptible  and  as  a  result  highly-respected  aristocra  tic  family  had  built  up.   The  countess,  then  34  years  old,  saddled  her  thoroughbred  foxhunter  and  set  out  on  a  long  ride  westwards,  more  than  1,200  miles  from  Konis  berg  in  East  Prussia  to  Hamburg.   There  she  soon  was  the  ccntre  of  discussion  be  cause  she  was  utterly  opposed  to  the  generalisa  tion  that  all  Germans  were  Nazis.   Her  letter  of  protest  did  not  actually  reach  the  British  supreme  comman  der  at  that  time  but  neither  did  it  go  unheard.   The  management  of  'Die  Zeit',  a  weekly  news  paper  devoted  to  politics  and  culture,  engaged  Dr  Marion  Countess  Donhoff,   who  is  a  doctor  of  poiiti-.  cal  science,  as  its  deputy   chief  editor.   Her  campaigns  against   what  she  considered  to  be  Chancellor  Adenauer's  in  flexible  policies,  for  the  freedom  of  Berlin,  her  struggle  against  everything  which  she  considered  un  democratic  made  her  known  around  the  world.   In  1962,  she  received  an  honorary  doctorate  from  the  faculty  of  philosophy  of  (he  Smith  College  (USA),  1964,  the  Joseph  E.  Drexel  prize  for  out  standing  journalistic  work,  1965,  the  Theodor  Heuss  prize  as  an  engaged  and  professed  citizen  of  a  democratic  Germany  for  outstanding  examples  of  civil  courage  and  exemp  lary  political  style.  In  1968  she  was  awarded  the  Isa  bclle  d'  Estc  prize,  only  given  to  women  and  which  is  presented  for  outstand  ing  achievements  in  some  particular  field  according  to  the  wishes  of  its  foun  der,  Princess  Ganzaga.   Then  on.  July  1,  1968,  the  woman  who  had  form  erly  been  the  owner  of  vast  estates,  bccamc  editor  of  'Die  Zeit',  circulation  300,000,;  and  considered  by  many  people  to  be  the  best  publication  of  its  kind  in  Europe.   Her  employees  say  she  is  clever,  cool,  just  and  conscientious.  Countess  Donhoff  has  not  married   and  in  her  spare  time  loves  hunting,  riding,  driving  a  Porsche  car  and,  of  course,  writing.",1969-09-10T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/107891576,"From Herbert Hecht in Hamburg.

262385154,GERMAN SOUL-SEARCHING,"  GERMAN   SOUL-SEARCHING   Jk  reader  sent  me  a  most   interesting  article  j  in  “Jedioth  Chadashoth”,  [an   Israeli  daily  of  the  more  Vhighbrow”  variety  which  is  published  in  the  German  langue;  !   The  article;  which  was   duly  translated  for  me,  yras  concerned  with  a'  very  defin  itive  wave  of  German  con   versions  to  Judaism.  '  j.   The  article  was  written   ^by  Schalom  Ben-Chorini  a   well-known  journalist  who  travelled  in  Northern  Ger  many  in  cities  such  as  Ham  burg  and  Luebeck,  and  also   in  the  Rhineand,  talking  to   the  various  people  concern  ed,  finding  out  what  lay  be   hind  this  emergence  of  j  in   terest  in  Judaism  and  what  was  the  moving  spirit  [be  hind  this,  desire  to  embrace   the  Jewish  faith.  j   The  article  is  extraordin  arily  interesting,  and  I  can  only  give  one  or  two  of  the  main  points  of  interest.  B^n-Chorin  finds  two  m  ain  reasons  why  this  should  be  in  the  country  he  calls  “the  land  without  Jews”.   The  first  one  is  that  the  young  people  haven’t  man  aged  to  come  to  terms  with  the  past.  They  are  met  by  a  “\vall  of  silence”.  Says  Ben  Chorin:  “Those  who  don’t   want  to  share  the  guiltj  of   their  fathers  feel  some  need  to  move  from  the.  camp  of  the  persecutor  to  the  camp  of  the  persecuted...”   This,  I  think,.  must  be   cepted  as  a  pretty  true  pic  ture  of  a  large  section  of  German  youth  today.   It  is  the  verdict  of  Gud  ilin  Tempel  in  her  passion  ately  sincere  book  “Speak  ing  Frankly  About  The  Ger  mans”,  and  it  is  the  verdict  of  the  investigation  which  we  saw  on  our  Television  sets'a  few  weeks  ago  where  every  young  German  said,  in  effect:  “...  We  cannot  talk  to  our  parents...  Nor  can  we  believe  that  they  didn’t  know  what  was  hap  pening  ..   Young  Germans  have  come  into  direct  Jewish  con  tact  due  to  the  co-operation  between  various  Israeli  and  German  youth  organisa  tions.  Perhaps  they  feel  a  need  to  expiate  the  sins  of  their  fathers.  Perhaps  it  is  merely  the  most  violent  re  bellion  they  can  make  against.  the  standards  of  their  fathers.   t^|7^HATEVER  the  rensons,   according  ,  to  this  ar  ticle,'  the  conversions  go  on.  The  Rabbis  treat  them  with  more  than  reserve.  The  training  period  is  so  long  that  only  the  most  deter  mined  survive  the  delay.   The  Rabbis  are  of  course  extremely  reluctant  in  the  case  of  older  Germans,  but  the  young  ones  they  cannot  reject.  In  one  group  alone,  in  Hamburg,  Hr.  Ben-Cho  rin  met  ten  young  Germans  in  process  of  being  convert   ed.  This  was  only  one  of   many  groups.   But  there  is,  according  to  this  article,'  a  second  reason  for  the  conversions.  It  is  a  purely  religious  swing  away  from  the  conception  of  the  Trinity  —  a  return  and  a  need  for  a  monotheistic  God.   Even  various  •  Theological  Colleges;  that  previously  re  jected  Judaism  as  the  moth  er  religion  from  which  Christianity  came,  have  now  changed  their  teachings  to  acknowledge  that  Christia  nity  owes  the  greater  part   of  its  teaching  to  the  parent  religion.   It  is  of  course  easy  to  see  in  a  fragmentary  German  desire  to  embrace  Judaism  a  great  deal  more  than  it  war  rants.  Psychologists  will  see  in  it  a  murderer’s  desire  to  embrace  the  body  of  the  vic  tim,  or  a  guilt  expiation  at   Yet  it  isn’t  likely  that  Jewish  religious  authorities  will  welcome  these  converts  with  great  joy.   There  is  something  a  little  unhealthy  in  this  converting  impulse.   The  Germans  —  on  the  other  side  of  the  coin  that  shows  brutality  and  sadism  —have  always  had  a  mas  ochistic  streak  as  well.  It  could  be  that  this  rejection  of  their  parents’  standards  is  an  example  of  this  char  acteristic.   Whatever  the  causes,  Mr.  Ben-Chorin’s  story  fits  a  new  piece  into  the  jig-saw  puzzle  that  is  Germany  to  day.  .",1964-02-21T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/262385154,"A reader sent me a most interesting article in “Jedioth Chadashoth”, an Israeli daily of the more",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article262385154?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1960-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1969-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The Australian Jewish News (Melbourne, Vic. : 1935 - 1999)",122.6368179321289,very relevant

262979193,GERMAN COMPENSATION ADOPTION,"  GERMAN  COMPENSATION   ADOPTION   Prepared  for  “Jewish  News  by  Dr.  0.  Freyer,   Sydney.   ^HE  final  Compensation  Law  (Schlussentschae   digungsgesetz)  is  likely  to  be  enacted  at  the  end  of  June,  and  probably  comes  into  operation  at  the  beginning  of  July.   After  deliberation  for  twc  years,  the  Compensation  Law  Committee  of  the  German  Parliament  submitted  a  ma  jority  report  to  the  Lower  House  on  May  13  and  the  second  and  third  readings  of  the  respective  draft  legisla  tion  was  expected  to  take  place  soon  after.   The  Report,  based  on  the  draft  previously  submitted  by   the  German  Government  in  November,  1903,  if  enacted  will  result  in  wide-spread  changes  in  the  structure  of  the  compensation  legislation,  i   It  is  expected  that  the  law  will  be  adopted  on  the  basis  of  this  Report,  with  minor  alterations.   IRON  CURTAIN   The  main  features  of  the  Report  include_   (a)  Claims  of  persecutees  who  left  the  Iron  Curtain  countries  after  October  1,  1953  .  (so  called'  “post  ‘53  cases”)_   A  fund  will  be  created  amounting  to  DM  700,000,000  from  which  the  claims  of  this  group  will  be  satisfied.   Persecutees  entitled  to  com  pensation  are  those  who  were  deprived  of  their  liberty  for  a  period  not  less  than  G  months  (the  mere  wearing   of  a  “David  Star”  or  the  i  living  under  legality  is  not  sufficient)  or  those  who  are  a.t  the  present  time  at  least  80%  incapacitated  or  widows  who  lost  their  husbands  as  a  result  of  persecution  and  who  did  not  re-marry.   The  basic  compensation  will  amount  to  DM  2,000.  How  ever,  persons  who  are  over  the  age  of  G5  years  are  en  titled  to  DM  2,500  and  widows  who  lost  their  husbands  as  n  result  of  persecution  DM  3,000.  Widow’s  who  were  deprived  of  their  liberty  for  not  less  thdn  1  year  are  entitled  to  DM  5,000.   This  basic  compensation  will  be  paid  immediately  af  ter  the  case  of  each  ap  plicant  has  been  proved.   The  additional  compensa  tion  will  be  determined  on  the  basig  of  funds  remaining  after  satisfying  all  applicants  in  respect  of  their  basic  com  pensation  and  in  determining  this  additional  compensation  tlie  following  graduations  will  apply:—   (x)  Persecutees  who  were  deprived  of  their  liberty  for  1  or  2  years  will  receive  a  single  fixed  amount   (xx)  Persecutees  who  were  deprived  of  their  liberty  for  2  to-  3  years  will  receive  double  the  fixed  amount.   (xxx)  Persecutees  who  where  deprived  of  their  liber   >  ty  for  3  to  4  years  will  re  ,•  ceive  treble  the  fixed  amount.  i  (xxxx)  Persecutees  who  .  were  deprived  of  their  liber  .  ty  for  more  than  4  years  will   receive  four  times  the  fixed  :  amount.   (xxxxx)  Widows  will  re  ’  ceive  5  times  the  fixed  !  amount.   The  maximum  additional  compensation  will  be  five  times  the  fixed  amount.   OTHER  GROUNDS   There  are  no  special  pro  visions  for  compensation  in  respect  of  “loss  of  health”,  however,  the  Government  is  entitled  to  divert  the  balance  remaining  of  the  afore  mentioned  funds  in  order  to  satisfy  the  claims  of  perse  cutees  who  suffered  exces  sive  loss  of  health.   (b)  Special  Drovision  for  persecutees  being  non-Ger  man  Nationals  who  were  persecuted  on  grounds  other  than'  racial  or  religious  (Po  les,  Czech,  Russians,  Ukrain  ians  etc.).   Compensation  ■  for  loss  of  health  is  provided  for  per  sons  who  held  the  status  of  Political  Refugees  on  Octo  ber  1,  1953.  This  is  provided  in  one  or  the  other  of  the  following  cases:—   (i)  Persons  who  suffer-1  ed  injuries  as  a  result  of  being  ill-treated  through  the  ignoring  of  human  rights  and  therefore  at  the  present  time  are  permanently  incapacitated   to  the  extent  of  not  less  than  25%.  This  group  is  en  titled  to  claim  compensation  bv  way  of  a  pension  as  from  October  1,  1953.   (ii)  Persons  who  ^were  brought  to  Germany  as  forced  labourers  .  (ZwangSarbeiter)  and  who,  through  ill-treat  ment,  contracted  some  form  of  illness  which  at  the  pre   sent  time  reduced  their  work  ing  capacity  bv  50%,  are  entitled  to  claim  a  pension  as  from  October  1,  1960.   Persons  included  under  item  (i)  and  who  became  political  persecutees  after  October  1,  1953  are  entitled  to  claim  compensation  in  form  of  a  lump  sum  payment  of  DM  6,000.  The  claims  of  per  secutees  included  under  points  (al  and  .(to)  above  must  be  lodged  by  September  30,1966.   (c)  Submission,  of  New  Claims.   A  person  who  made  a  gene  ral  claim  application  for  com  pensation  in  the  due  time  is  entitled  to  submit  a  new  claim,  although  this  claim  was  not  included  or  even  ex  cluded  in  his  general  ap  plication.  This  provision  ap  plies  subject  that  the  new  submission  is  made  riot  later  than  -  September  1,  1965.   (d)  Special  provisions  for  “loss  of  health”  in  respect  of  concentration  camp  in-mates.   Persons  who  were  interned  iin  a  concentration  camp  for  not  less  than  one  year  and  who,  at  present,  due  to  ill  ness  which  is  relative  to  their  internship  in  such  camps,  having  a  working  incapacity  through  illness  at  the  pre  sent  time  of  not  less  than  25%  will  be  entitled  to  take  advantage  of  a  legal  presump  tion  that  the  illness  was  actually  due  to  persecution.   The  Government  is  author  ised  to  determine  by  way  of   decree  what  camps  are  to  be  regarded  as  concentration  camps,  having  in  mind  that  camps  under  supervision  of  the  S.C.:  will  not  be  the  only  ones  covered  by  same.   (e)  Opening  of  “Loss  of  Health”  claims  which  such  claims  were  repudiated.   If  a  case  was  repudiated  only  on  medical  grounds  it  may  be  re-opened  when  the  facts  brought  forward  in  evidence  at  the  time  of  hear  ing  are  now  considered  to  be  contrary  to  accepted  medical  and  scientific  knowledge  and/  or  on  the  other  hand  if  it  proves  to  be  contrary  to  the  present  legal  interpretation  adopted  by  the  Supreme  Court.   (f)  Compensation  for  “Loss  of  Education”.   Additional  compensa  t  i  o  n  amounting  to  DM  5,000  is  provided  for  this  group  of  persecutees  who  where  forced  to  interrupt  their  education  and  who  failed  to  continue   same.   The  features  listed  above  are  the  main  ones  which  will  be  adopted  in  the  new  law  however  they  are  not  ex  haustive.   It  is  expected  that  both  j   Houses  of  the  German  Par-  •   liament  will  adopt  this  law  oh  the  lines  submitted  by  the  majority  of  the  Compensa  tion  Law  Committee.   It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  main  difference  of  opinion  of  the  Committee  members  was  as  to  the  ex  tent  of  compensation  due  for  the  so  called  “post  ’53  cases’’.  There'  is  a  minority  Report  as  to  this  problem  which  seeks  inter  alia:—   (aa)  Compensation  to  be  paid  for  loss  of  liberty  amounting  to  DM  150  for  every  month  applicable.   (bb)  Widows  who  lost  their  husbands  as  a  result  of  per  secution  to  receive  a  pension  of  DM  250  as  from  July  1,   1965.   (cc)  Persons  who  are  at  least  60%  incapacitated  through  illness  resulting  from  their  wartime  experiences  to  receive  pension  of  DM  250  as  from  July  1,  1965.   It  is  not  likely  that  these  minority  proposals  will  be  adopted  by  the  German  Par  liament.  The  Minority  Report  proposes  in  addition,  an  in  crease  in  the  fund  for  so  called  “post  ’53  cases’’  to  DM  850,000,000  and  it  is  probable  that  this  proposal  oply  will  be  adopted.",1965-06-18T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/262979193,"THE final Compensation Law (Schlussentschaedigungsgesetz) is likely to be enacted at the end of June, and probably comes into operation at the beginning of July.",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article262979193?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1960-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1969-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The Australian Jewish News (Melbourne, Vic. : 1935 - 1999)",122.60318756103516,very relevant

263031102,THIS GERMAN THOROUGHNESS,"  THIS  GERMAN  THOROUGHNESS   By  a  cunning  legal  tricK,  west  German  law  makers  appear  1o  have  sneaked  through  the  West  German  parliament  a  law  amendment  which,  unless  rescinded,  may  release  from  prosecution  most  Nazi  criminals  still  unpunished.   The  loophole  provision  is  so  complicated  that  it  evaded  the  vigilance  of  those  members  of  the  West  German  parliament  who  are  genuinely  in  favour  of  continuing  prosecution  of  Nazis  involved  in  mass  murder;  but  the'Federal  Supreme  Court,  in  a  test  case  decided  on  May  21st,  ruled  that  the  new  legal  amendment  is  valid  law.   Stripped  of  the  legal  verbiage  under  the  Ger  man  Penal  Code,  an  accessory  to  a  crime  is  equally  legally  responsible  with  the  main  culprit,  and  thus  a  person  accessory  to  murder  can  be  dealt;  with  exactly  as  the  murderer  himself.   In  September  last  year,  an  apparently  harm   less  amendment  to  the  Penal  Code  was  sneaked  through  parliament;  most  of  the  clauses  of  the  amendment  were  in  fact  perfectly  straightforward  minor  emendations  dealing  with  cases  of  unclear  wording  and  similar  deficiencies.   One  clause;  however,  which  was  represented  to  parliament  as  a  method  of  relieving  minor  offenders—traffic  offenders,  for  Instance—of  over  severe  penalties,  vitally  amended  Paragraph  50   of  the  Penal  Code.   Under  the  old  version  of  this  paragraph,  accessories  were  equally  responsible  wilh  the  main  culprit;  in  the  amended  version,  accessories  were  allotted  a  lesser  share  of  legal  responsibility  unless  it  could  be  shown  that  they  were  acting  ""from  base  motives  or  with  malice  aforethought"".   It  is  today  clear  that  this  clause  was  inserted  by  pro-Nazi  legal  draftsmen,  who  wished  to  create  a  loophole  for  Nazi  offenders;  but  the  catch  was  not  spotted  by  legislators,  and  the  .amendment  passed  parliament  without  challenge.",1969-08-08T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/263031102,"By a cunning legal trick, West German lawmakers appear to have sneaked through the West German parliament a law amendment which, unless rescinded, may release from prosecution",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article263031102?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1960-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1969-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The Australian Jewish News (Melbourne, Vic. : 1935 - 1999)",122.58502197265625,very relevant

R   Fest’s  book  is,  of  course,  a  German’s  interpretation  of  the  Hitler  period  which   makes  it  even  more  in  teresting.  In  fact,  Fest,  the  editor  of  Albert  Speer’s  memoirs  and  the  author  of  the  book,  “The  Faces  of  the  '  Third  Reich'’,  was  asked  to   do  the  biography  by  New  York  publisher,  William  Jovanovich  who  was   specifically  looking  for  a   German  view.   The  48-year-old  Fest  said  that  he  had  always  wanted  to  do  something  about  this  period.   He  explained  -that  his  family  was  persecuted  by  the  Nazis  since  his  father  .had  belonged  to  anti-Nazi  parties  and  had  lost  his  Job   as  an  educator  after  Hitler  came  to  power.   Fest  himself  was  drafted  .  into  an  aircraft  battery  unit  at  the  age  of  15  and  two  years  later  was-captured  by  the  U.S.  Army  and  spent  }the  final  two  years  of  the  :war  as  a  POW.   The  book  itself  is  one  that   deserves  reading  by  .anyone  interested  in  the  Nazi  era  and  how  a  man  like  Hitler  could  take  control  of  a  major  nation.   As  a  book  on  Hitler  it  desetves  a  place  along  with  Allan  Bullock’s  “Hitler:  A  Study  in  Tyranny”  and  William  Shirer’s  “The  Rise  and  Fall  of  the  Third   Reich”  v   .

237865404,Historic German accord,"  Historic  German  accord   The  convincing  win  of  Chancellor  Willy  Brandt's  ruling  coalition  in  the  November  19  West  German  elections  strongly  confirms  the  present  tendency  to  detente  in  Europe.   Brandt  s  success  was  particularly  sig  nificant  coming  as  it  did  immediately  following  the  initialling  of  his  govern  ment's  new  treaty  with  the  German  De  mocratic  Republic.  Conservative  opinion  in  West  Germany  is  notoriously  neural  gic  over  questions  of  relations  with  the  GDR.  The  fact  that  Brandt  was  so  strongly  confirmed  in  power  just  after  such  a  bold  step  had  been  taken  to  improve  relations  between  the  two  Germanys  says  much  for  the  profound  and  positive  changes  now  taking  place  in  West  Ger  man  opinion  on  external  policies.  One  can  gain  some  idea  of  the  extent  to  which  the  realities  of  power  are  chang  ing  attitudes  in  the  modern  world  by  re  calling  certain  past  attitudes  expressed  by  spokesmen  for  the  two  sides  in  Ger  many.  For  example,  Herr  Brandt  himself,  who  in  the  election  staked  his  fate  as  Chancellor  on  his  Ostpolitik  of  improv  ing  relations  with  the  East,  including  the  GDR,  said  in  West  Berlin  on  September  5,  1963:  ""The  Ulbricht  regime  is  a  cancerous  tumor  in  the  bosom  of  the  German  peo  ple.  It  must  be  eliminated.""  The  present  leader  of  the  GDR's  Soc  ialist  Unity  Party,  Herr  Erich  Honecker,  said  in  March,  1971:  ""The  term  inter-German  (  innerdeutch  )  is  nothing  but  a  new  variant  of  the  West  German  spirit  of  fevanchism  against  the  GDR.""  As  reported  by  the  GDR  newsagency,  ADN,  the  new  treaty  consists  of  a  pre  amble  and  10  articles.  In  it  the  two  parties  proceed  from  their  responsibility  for  the  maintenance  of  peace,  from  their  endeavour  to  make  a  contribution  to  detente  and  security  in  Europe,  as  well  as  from  historic  facts.  The  GDR  and  the  FRG,  according  to  article  one,  shall  ""develop  normal  good-  neighborly  relations  with  each  other  on  the  basis  of  equal  rights.""  In  article  two  they  stipulate  that  they  ""shall  be  guided  by  the  purposes  and  principles  laid  down  in  the  Charter  of  the  United  Nations,  in  particular  the  sovereign  equality  of  all  states,  respect   for  independence,  autonomy  and  terri  torial  integrity,  the  right  to  self-deter  mination,  the  protection  of  human  rights  and  non-discrimination.""  Article  three  stipulates  that  in  ac  cordance  with  the  United  Nations  Char  ter  the  GDR  and  the  FRG  ""shall  settle  their  disputes  only  by  peaceful  means   and  refrain  from  the  threat  or  use  of  force.""  ""They  affirm  the  inviolability  now  and  in  the  future  of  the  frontier  exist  ing  between  them  and  undertake  to  fully  respect  each  other's  territorial  integrity.""  On  this  point  the  preamble  to  the  treaty  says  ""that  the  inviolability  of  the   frontiers  and  respect  for  the  territorial  integrity  and  sovereignty  of  all  states  in  Europe  within  their  present  frontiers  are  a  basic  prerequisite  for  peace.""  A  supplementary  protocol  on  article  three  lays  down  the  formation  of  a  com  mission  of  authorised  representatives  of  the  Governments  of  the  two  states.  This  commission  ""will  examine  the  marking  of  the  frontier  existing  between  the  two  states  and,  if  need  be,  renew  or  comple  ment  it  as  well  as  work  out  the  necessary  documentations  on  the  delimitation  of  the  frontier.""  Other  articles  of  the  treaty  say  ""that  neither  of  the  two  states  may  represent  the  other  in  international  affairs  or  act  on  its  behalf.""  The  GDR  and  the  FRG  shall  promote  peaceful  relations  between  the  European  states  and  contribute  to  security  and  cooperation  in  Europe  and  support  ef  forts  designed  to  bring  about  arms  limi  tation  and  disarmament.  The  contracting  parties  ""proceed  from  the  principle  that  the  sovereign  power  of  either  state  shall  be  confined  to  its  respective  territory.  They  shall  respect  the  independence  and  autonomy  of  either  state  in  its  internal  and  external  affairs.""  The  GDR  and  the  FRG  declare  their  readiness  ""to  settle  practical  and  human  itarian  matters  as  they  normalise  their  relations.""  On  this  point  article  seven  provides  for  agreements  to  develop  co  operation  in  the  fields  of  the  economy,  science  and  technology,  traffic,  legal  rela  tions,  posts  and  telecommunications,  health,  culture,  sports,  environmental  protection  and  other  fields.  Details  have  been  settled  in  a  supplementary  proto  col  .  Both  states  shall  exchange  permanent  representations  which  shall  be  establish  ed  at  the  seat  of  the  respective  govern-  '  ment.  ;  f  The  GDR  arid  the  FRG  are  agreed  ""that  bilateral  and  multilateral  inter  national  treaties  and  agreements  con  cluded  earlier  by  them  or  concerning  them  shall  not  be  affected  by  this  treaty.""  Both  German  states  are  now  expected  to  make  application  to  join  the  United  Nations,  and  to  be  admitted  formally  as  members  on  September  18,  1973,  open  ing  date  of  the  next  General  Assembly.",1972-11-28T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/237865404,The convincing win of Chancellor Willy Brandt's ruling coalition in the November 19 West German elections strongly confirms the present tendency to,https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article237865404?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1970-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1979-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"Tribune (Sydney, NSW : 1939 - 1991)",122.64891052246094,very relevant

Bankhaus  Herstatt  KG,  of  Cologne,  was  officially  or  dered  to  cease  business  yes  terday  and  turn  in  its  bank  ing  licence  because  it  had  run  up  heavy  losses  in  foreign  exchange  deals.   The  move,  ordered  by  the   Federal  Supervisory  Office  for  the  Banking  Industry  and  announced  by  the  Central  Bank,  immediately  prompted  speculation  that  Herstatt  was  not  the  only  bank  in  trouble  over  foreign  exchange  trans  actions.   The  Central  Bank  an  nouncement  said  Herstatt's   losses  —  unofficially  estimated   to  total  the  equivalent  of  about  SA52.8  million,  were  caused  by  forward  exchange  deals,  a  form  of  currency  speculation.   Herstatt,  a  private  company  founded  19  years  ago,  was  ordered  to  wind  up  business  just  one  day  after  the  Central  Bank  announced  new  rules  tightening  surveil  lance  of  forward  exchange  operations.

237868826,Dunstan's German idea,"  punstan's  German  idea   Bv  John  Playford   nurinff  his  12-day  visit  to  West  Ger-  ""  v  iii  January  of  this  year,  South  Australia's  Labor  Premier  Don  Dunstan  appears  to  have  become  infatuated  with   their  theory  or  wurKei  yai  m  management.  Returning  to  Adelaide,  he  soon  established  two  committees  to  in  vestigate  the  implementation  of  worker  participation  in  the  management  of  pub  lic  authorities  and  private  industry  in  South  Australia.  The  terms  of  reference  and  the  composition  of  these  bodies  have  not  yet  been  released,  although  it  is  known  that  a  number  of  social  scientists  are  closely  involved  in  the  whole  operation.  .  Membership  is-  said  to  include:  Prof.  G  M.  Badger,  Vice-Chancellor,  Univer  sity  of  Adelaide  and  a  member  of  the  Adelaide  Club;  Ian  Hay  ward,  Joint  Managing-Director  of  John  Martin  &  Co.  Ltd.,  Director  of  South  Australian  Insurance  Holdings  Ltd.,  and  also  a  member  of  the  Adelaide  Club;  J.  R.  Dri-  dan,  Chairman  of  the  Electricity  Trust  of  South  Australia;  John  Rob  bins,-  a  lec  turer  in  Politics,  University  of  Adelaide;  and  Jim  Shannon,  anti-communist  sec  retary,  S.A.  Trades  &  Labor  Council.  Machinery  for  worker  participation  in  management  has  been  introduced  by  government  legislation  in  West  Germany  on  a  wider  scale  than  any  other  ad  vanced  capitalist  country.  With  Chris  tian  Democratic  Union  and  Social  De  mocratic  Party  support  the  Codetermina-  tion  Law  was  passed  in  1951,  under  which  the  practice  was  instituted  in  the  coal  and  steel  industries.  Further  legis  lation  in  the  following  year  gave  legal  status  to  worker  participation  in  man  agement  in  all  private  and  public  com  panies.  The  ideology  built  around  codetermina-  tion,  known  as  Mitbestimmung,  was  an  attempt  to  narrow  political  and  econo  mic  differences  between  management  and  worker  to  compel  them  to  collabor  ate  in  the  factory,  thus  opening  the  way  to  the  harmonious  social  and  economic  reconstruction  of  postwar  West  Ger  many.  As  Herbert  J.  Spiro  wrote  in  The  Politics  of  German  Codetermination  (Harvard  University  Press,  1958):  ""Co-  determination  became  a  vast  educational  scheme  designed,  over  a  period  of  years,  to  raise  the  workers'  level  of  understand  ing  and  thereby  to  help  bring  about  so  cial  peace  and  thus-  reduce  the  extent  of  the  sphere  of  political  conflict,  or  at  least  its  violence"",  (p.  8).  The  evidence  shows  clearly  that  par  ticipation  leads  to  close  identification  with  management.  To  quote  from  Adolph  Sturmthal's  Workers'  Control  (Harvard  University  Press,  1964):  ""But  the  change  was  not  automatically  one  to  a  system  of  democratic  partnership  but  rather  to  joint  paternalism.  The  significant  fact  is  that  in  many  cases  the  works'  coun  cil  has  joined  in  the  system  and  has  be  come  a  partner  in  a  management  team  which  administers  the  labor  force  of  the  enterprise  with  authority  and  benevol  ence.""  (p.  68).  It  is  clear  that  managers  in  Germany  regard  worker  participation  in  manage  ment  as  a  means  to  reduce  the  influence  of  unions  inside  the  factory,  thereby  re  ducing  the  ability  of  workers  to  unite  in  presenting  demands  to  management.  The  famous  labour  lawyer  and  political  scientist  Franz  Neumann  wrote  in  Ger  many  and  the  Future  of  Europe,  edited  by  Hans  J.  Morgenthau  (University  of  Chicago  Press,  1952):  ""It  has  become  in  creasingly  doubtful  to  me  if  any  program  of  codetermination  is  viable  and  desir  able,  and  I  have  become  more  and  more   convinced  that  in  reality  the  program  far  from  achieving  anything,  may  actu  ally  destroy  the  little  militancy  that  is  left  in  the  German  labor  movement.""  (p.  103).  Participation  in  management  in  capi  talist  countries  is  essentially  an  experi  ence.  that  mystifies  the  workers  as  to  their  real  position.  Real  power  in  West  Germany  has  not  been  placed  in  the  hands  of  the  workers.  Management  still  take  all  important  policy  decisions;  the  factories  are  still  owned  by  the  share  holders;  the  workers  are  still  hired  labor.  Mitbestimmung  is  a  capitalist  theory  of  industrial  democracy,  the  latest  attempt  to  abandon  the  notion  of  class  struggle  and  to  entice  the  workers  away  from  socialism.  Understandably,  it  holds  considerable  attraction  for  the  technocratic  Premier  of  South  Australia  who  informed  the  Na  tional  Youth  Council  in  1969  that  ""pri  vate  enterprise  is  a  meaningless  phrase""  and  who  asserted  before  the  American  Chamber  of  Commerce  in  Australia  in  1970  that  the  appropriation  of  private  capital  was  a  ""totally  discredited  idea.""",1972-04-18T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/237868826,"During his 12-day visit to West Germany in January of this year, South Australia's Labor Premier Don Dunstan appears to have become infatuated with",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article237868826?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1970-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1979-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"Tribune (Sydney, NSW : 1939 - 1991)",122.56446075439453,very relevant

262928849,"MIDDLE EAST German view (from the German Tribune, a weekly review of the German Press)","  MIDDLE  EAST  ——————————————————————————   German  view    BY  WERNER  HOLZER   (from  the  German  Tribune,  a  weekly  review  of  the  German  Press)      Even  if  an  armistice  agreement  is  signed,  none  of  the  problems  that  have  made  the  Middle  East  a  continually  ticking  time  bomb  will  be  solved,  the  two  overwhelming  obstacles  to  peace  being  the  problem  of  the  homeless  Palestinians  and  the  Arabs’  hurt  pride  at  continually  sustaining  defeats  and  being  so  unable  to  help  themselves.     Israel’s  growing  reluctance  to  return  the  territories  occupied  in  1967  in  return  for  Arab  recognition  of  the  Jewish  state  is  likewise  an  ob-  stacle.   There  can  be  little  doubt  that  Israel’s  policy  in   recent  years  has  been  based  on  a  feeling  of  such  military  superiority  over  the  other  side  that  Jerusalem  was  intent  on   itself  deciding  the  form  possible  negotiations  were  to  take  and  the  extent  to  which  they  were  to  go.   The  Arab  governments  have  not  played  ball,  and  even  if  they  and  Israel  had  reached  agreement  on  negotiations  there  would  still  be  the  Palestinians,  who  are  operating  in-  creasingly  independently  and   ever  more  intently  on  destroying  the  Jewish  State.   The  Palestinians  (and  for  long  enough  the  Arab,  governments  too)  have  invariably  counted  on  massive  Soviet  support,  much  as  Israel  has  relied  on  continuing  aid  from  the  United  States.   In  Cairo  and  Damascus,  not  to  mention  other  Arab  capitals,  growing  doubts   have  for.  some  time  arisen  as  to  the  disinterested  nature  of  Soviet  support.  There  was  an  uneasy  and  not  entirely  unjustifiable  feeling  that  continuation  of   the  current  situation  midway  between  war  and  peace  was  probably  most  in  accord  with  Soviet  in-  terests  and  intentions.   Israel,  on  the  other  hand,  has  thus  far  shunned  serious  consideration  of  the  prospect  of  a  change  in  relations  with  its  major  ally.   Over  the  past  year  it  may  have  grown  obvious  enough  that  the  United  States  is   heading  towards  an  energy  crisis  that  will  no  longer  allow  it  to  enter  into  major  conflict  with  the  Arab  oil  exporting  countries,  yet  Mrs.  Meir’s  government  seems  unwilling  to  acknowledge  that  the  resulting  political  con-  sequences  for  Israel  could  prove  unforeseeable.     MUTUAL     At  all  events  there  are  growing  indications  that  Washington  is  at  least  as  strongly  interested  in  detente  with  the  Soviet  Union  and  unhindered  petroleum  supplies  as  it  is  in  good  relations  with  Israel.   This  being  the  case,  there  is  little  point  in  concluding  a  new  armistice  agree-  ment  in  the  Middle  East  without  at  the  same  time  making  a  genuine  attempt  to  reach  fundamental   solutions  —  an  attempt  that  must  be  made  by   both  sides.   Israel  will  not,  of  course,  want,  to  hear  anything  of  the  necessity,  and  it  will  be  up  to  the  Arab  govern-   ments  to  convince  the  Palestinian  leaders  that  their  hopes  of  total  destruction  of  the  Jewish  State  will  never  be  fulfilled,  the  conclusion  being  that  there  will  have  to  be  a  negotiated  solution,  albeit  one  that  takes  Palestinian   interests  into  accounts.",1973-11-02T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/262928849,"Even if an armistice agreement is signed, none of the problems that have made the Middle East a continually ticking time Bomb will be solved, the two overwhelming",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article262928849?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1970-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1979-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The Australian Jewish News (Melbourne, Vic. : 1935 - 1999)",113.96669006347656,very relevant

131717816,Some German varieties WINE,"  Some  German  varieties   By  DAN  MURPHY   In  the  course  of  our  study  of   medium-priced  white  wines,  inevitably  we  must  come  across  the  average  quality  but  popular  German  wines  which  arc  available  in  so  many  bottle  shops.   Immediately  to  your  minds  will  spring  the  thought  that  the  ubi  quitous  Blue  Nun  Licbfraumilch  is  included  in  this  group,  but  one  could  hardly  call  a  wine  sold  at  S4.36  a  bottle  a  medium  priccd   wine.   Whatever  may  be  the  reasons,  the  fact  that  Blue  Nun  is  one  of  the  three  or  four  top  selling  wines  of  the  world  is  not  due  to  its  price.   Kenderman's  ""Black  Tower""  Licbfraumilch  which  has  hecome  the  sccond-largcst  selling  Ger  man  wine  in  the  world,  for  the  very  same  reason,  cannot  be  nom  inated  as  a  medium-priced  wine.   This  month  Kcndcrman,  through  its  associated  company  —  Havcrmcycr  —  is  releasing  another  Licbfraumilch  callcd  Wild  Soar.  In  n  similar  ""crock""  type  bottle,  it  will  sell  at  the  same  price  as  Black  Tower  (about  S3.60).   These  three  are  stereotyped  wines  of  fairly  high  quality  which  depend  for  their  success  on  the  continuity  of  their  style  and  stan  dard  from  year  to  year,  country  to  country  and  bottle  to  bottle.   Licbfraumilch  docs  not  comc  from  one  German  district.  It  can  be  a  blend  but,  whatever  the  case,  it  is  a  matter  of  German  Wine  Law  that  it  has  its  origin  either  in  the  Rhcinhcsscn,  Rhcingau,  Nahe  or  Rheinpfalz  districts  ol  the  Rhine  Valley.   The  quality  of  Licbfraumilch  can  be  varied  but  in  fact,  what  ever  the  brand  name  or  shipper,  the  standard,  the  flavour  and  the  quality  is  much  the  same  and  it  is  extremely  unlikely  that  an  Aus  tralian  palate  could  pick  at  a   -   A  selection  of  German  whites.   ""blind""  tasting  one  brand  from   another.   ft  is  immensely  important,  therefore,  that  you  shop  around.  A  large  number  of  stores  in  the  capital  cities  have  Licbfraumilch  at  priccs  varying  from  SI.95  to  S2.50  a  bottle  which  makes  them  more  than  competitive  with  most  Australian  whites  in  a  similar  pricc  bracket  and  of  a  similar  style.   The  lowest  quality  German  whites  —  Tafclwein  —  do  not  seem  to  be  imported  into  Aus   tralia.   A  qualitatswein  must  come  from  a  particular  region,  be  made  from  certain  grape  varieties  and  have  an  alcoholic  strength  of  8'^  per  cent  by  volume.  Under  pres  ent-day  German  Wine  Law,  a  quality  wine  must  carry  the  name  of  the  vineyard,  vineyard  area  or   district.   Licbfraumilch  has  a  special  ruling.  It  must  be  a  qualitaiswcin  which  has  passed  the  test  and  has  an  official  examination  number.  Most  of  the  other  quality  wines   arc  district  wines,  that  is  wines  which  do  not  come  from  any  particular  maker  or  village  but  arc  from  anywhere  within  a  dis  trict  wfv'ch  imparts  a  similar  taste  to  all  its  wines.   Wc  might  say  that  the  Hunter  Valley  is  a  district  in  this  sense.  Such  a  district  or  particular  area  is  called  a  Bcrcich  and  if  the  label  docs  not  bear  the  name  of  the  vineyard  locality,  the  word  Bercich  must  appear  first  on  the  label.  We  might  say,  for  example,  that  Pokolbin  is  the  vineyard  locality  (or  grosslage)  in  the  dis  trict  (or  Bercich)  of  Hunter  Val  ley.   Most  of  the  cheaper  German  wines  (apart  from  Licb  fraumilch)  imported  into  Aus  tralia  are  district  or  Bercich  wines.  We  see,  accordingly,  such  names  as  Bcrcich  Nierstcin,  Bereich  Johannisberg,  Bereich  Bcrnkastel  and  so  on.  Many  of  these  arc  obtainable  at  from  S2.25  to  $2.75  a  bottle.   German  exporters  are  con  scious  of  the  fact  that  there  is  a   certain  hesitancy  among  English  speaking  wine  buyers  to  ask  for  a  wine  labelled  ""Bcrcich  some  thing  or  other"".  Before  the  new  German  Wine  Law,  wine  from  the  area  surrounding  the  village  of  Nicrstein  in  the  Rhcinhcssen   region  was  labelled  simply   ""Niersteiner"".   Now  it  must  be  called  Bcreich  Nicrstein.'   As  you  can  see,  I  am  not  trying  to  teach  you  the  intricacies  of  German  Wine  Law  but  merely  to  point  out  to  you  that  there  are  German  wines  on  the  market  which  might  have  queer  sounding  titles  but  are  very  good  and  ex  tremely  reasonable  in  price.   Fairly  familiar  names  to  Aus   tralians  are  Saar-Ruwer  and  Bcrnkastel  from  the  Moscl  Val   ley;  Nicrstein  and  Bingcn  from  the  Rhcinhcssen;  Johannisberg  from  the  Rhcingau.  Look  for  the  word  Bcrcich  before  these  names   today  and  you  will  know  that  the   label  describes  a  wine  from  grapes  grown  within  the  bound  aries  of  the  district  named.",1978-02-23T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/131717816,"IN the course of our study of medium-priced white wines, inevitably we must come across the average quality but",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131717816?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1970-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1979-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,The Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995),112.2234115600586,very relevant

214556790,pilbara pets GERMAN SHEPHERD,"  pilbara  pets   GERMAN  SHEPHERD   When  asking  a  friend  who  owns  one  of  these  magnificent  breed,  the  difference  between  the  Alsatian  and  German  Shep-  herd,  I  was  immediately  asked  if  I  knew  anything  about  dogs.  I  was  told  I  would  have  to  be  pretty  silly  not  to  know  the  difference  —  none.   During  the  World  Wars  the  British  dropped  the  name  German  Shepherd  and  decided  on  the  name,  Alsatian  Wolf  Dog.  This  is  probably  why  a  lot  of  people  associate  the  German  Shepherd  with  the  wolf,  but  it  is  totally  incorrect.  In  fact,  in  spite  of  their  wolf-like  appear-  ance,  the  German  Shepherd  belongs  to  the  breed  which  have  the  least  traces  of  wolves.  The  Shepherd  can  be  traced  farther  back  in  time  than  any  other  breed.  The  oldest  of  dogs  resembling  the  Shepherd  is  about  twenty  thousand  years  old.  The  breed  in  early  times  was  originally  used  for  hunting  and  as  a  watch  dog.  More  recently  they  have  been  used  as  Shepherd  dogs  watching  cattle,  hence  the  name.  They  were  also  once  regarded  as  the  only  dogs  suitable  of  guiding  the  blind.  They  are  now  also  used  as  police  dogs,  where  their  duties  entail:--  tracking,  rescue  and  messenger  carriers.  Above  all  they  are  an  excellent  family  pet.  They  seem  quite  suited  to  the  climate  of  the  Pilbara.  I  must  sympathize  with  the  owners  of  a  German  Shepherd  for  it  seems  that  they  are  always  the  first  to  have  the  finger  pointed  at  them  when  there  is  any  trouble.

250160157,GERMAN TROOPS FREE HOSTAGES,"  TROOPS   ?   BONN,  Tues,  AAP  —  West  German  commandos  attacked  behind  the  blinding  flash  of  special  grenades  and  swarmed  aboad  a  hijacked  Lufthansa  airline  at  Mogadisau  in  Somalia  to  kill  three  terrorists  and  free  unharmed  86  hostages  in  a  seyen-minute  raid  today.  The  West  German  Government  announced  that  a  woman  hijacker  was  wounded  and  captured.   The  spectacular  raid  on  the  jet  parked  on  a  runway  at  Mogadishu,  in  north-east  Africa,  came  about  90  minutes  before  a  deadline  set  by  the  hijackers  for  the  killing  of  the  hostages.  It  ended  a  five-day  ordeal  that  covered:  about  11,000  kilometres  and  took  the  plane  to  six  countries.  Among  those  rescued  were  11  West  Ger-.  man  beauty  queens  and  an  American-  woman.  Mrs  Christine  Santiago,  44,  of  Santee,  California  and-  her  five-year-old  son.  .  Authorities  said,  the  -hostages  would  return  to  Frankfurt  international  Airport  in  West  Germany  late  this  afternoon.  Two  ot  the  hijackers  were  members  of.  a  West  German  terrorist  gang  and  two  of  them  members  of  an  extremist  wing  of  the  Palestine  Liberation  Organisation.  Three  were  shot  dead  before  they  could  carry  out  their  threat  to  blow  up  the  plane,  and  one  German  raider,  the  woman,  was  wounded,  the.  Government  said,  Using  special  grenades  creating  a  blinding  flash  and  deafening  noise,  28  men  of  Unit  .9  of  the  Federal-Border  Troops  blew  open  the  Boeing  737's  doors  about  midnight,  the  Government  said.  A  swift  shoot-out  ensued  in  which  the  hijackers  were  shot  dead  and  within  seven  minutes  all  the  hostages  had  left  the  plane.  About  60  luen  of  the  crack  German  Unit  9  flew,  aboard  a  Lufthansa  Boeing  707  from  the  Greek  island  of.Crete  to  Mogadishu  yesterday,  landing  after  dark.  to  The  raid  was  directed  by  GerdBoeden,  head  of  the  anti-terrorist  squad  of  the  German  Federal  Police,  and  Ulrich  Wegener,  head  of  the  raiding  troops.  Spokesmen  said  they  had  been  secretly  following  the  hijacked  aircraft  on  its  trip.  Lufthansa  spokesman  Frank  Cesarz  said  the  raid  had  been  planned  to  the  last  detail.  ""The  men  of  the  frontier  protection  troops  had  trained  for  a  long  time  on.  an  aircraft  of  the  same  type,""  he  said.  The  border  guards  are  the  senior  military  arm  of  West  Germany.  They  were  the  first  armed  unit  formed  after  World  War  2.  Their  prime  mission  is  to'  guard.  West  Germany's  border  and  they  also  provide  elite  troops  that  guard  the  Chancellor,  President  and  other  Government  officials.  They  wear  a  'green  uniform,  boots  and  unmistakable  coal-shuttle  helmets  with  leather  flaps  at  the  rear.  :  The  lightning  •  raid  resembled  the  Israeli  raid,  at  Entebbe  Airport  in  Uganda  on  July  4,  1976,  when  Israeli  commandos  flew  secretly  into  the  airport  and  rescued  102  hijacked  hostages  in  a  shoot-out  with  Arab  and  West  German  terrorists.   The  hijackers  seized  the  German  Boeing  737  plane  at  midday  last  Thursday  over  the  French  Riviera  as  it  was  flying  from  Majorca  to  Frankfurt.  They  later  forced  the  plane  to  fly  to  Rome,  Cyprus,  Bahrain,  Dubai.  Aden  and  finally  Somalia.

Both  Germany  and  Turkey  stood  firm  as  one  deadline  after  another  set  by  the  hijackers  came  and  went.  Jubilation  in  Germany  was  dampened  by  the  death  of  Juergen  Schumann,  the  37-yearold  captain  of  the  plane  who  was.  shot  to  death  yesterday.  The  hijackers  unceremoniously  dumped  his  body  from  the  aircraft  while  the  hostages  watched  in  horror.,  There  was  still  no  word  on  the  fate  of  .industrialist  Hanns-Martin  Schleyer,  62,  kidnapped  by  West  German  terrorists  on  September  5.  An  ultimatum  on  his  life  expired  on  Sunday.  His  kidnappers  had  tied  his  fate  to  the  demands  of  the  four  hijackers.  The  special  plane  carrying  all  the  hostages  left  Mogadishu  at  5.30  am.  Injured  passengers  were,  given  first  aid  by  Somali  and  German  doctors  in  the  airport  waiting  room.Some  of  the  injured  were  taken  to  Medina  hospital  in  Mogadishu  for  treatment  and  then  returned  to  the  airport  for  the  flight  home:  The  Somali  news  agency,  Sonn  a,  quoted  Information  Minister  Abdulkasim  Salad-  Hasan  as  saying  the  rescue  operation  was  completed  in  10  minutes.  The  Minister  added  the  rescue  was  carried  out  ""by  Somali  security  forces  in  conjunction  with:  some  German  technical  experts.""  He  said  his  Government  had  no  option  but  to  use  force  ""to  save  the  lives  of  innocent  passengers,  once  all  other  channels  had  been  exhausted.""  Sonna.said  there  was  ""great.rejoicing""  at  Mogadishu's  small  airport  over  the  success  of  the  raid.  A  Lufthansa  spokesman  said  details  of  the  raid  were  sketchy.  Commandos  practised  attacking  an  identical  plane  before  being  sent  to  Mogadishu,  sources  said.  .  .  .  ..  .  They  stormed  into  the  aircraft  through  emergency  exits  on  both  wings,  without  any  warning  to  the  occupants  of  the  plane,  the  Lufthansa  spokesman  said.  Informed  sources  said  commandos  found  that  the  hijackers  had  placed  explosives  inside  the  plane  and  poured  petrol  onto  the  aisle  carpeting,  apparently  to  cause  ""a  fire  in  the  event  of  an  attack.  Passengers  were  bound  in  their  seats,  the  sources  said.  There  was  some  shooting,  causing  bullet  damage  to  the  inside  of  the  aircraft,  the  spokesman  said.  There  was  no  panic.  The  passengers  were  evacuated  as  fast  as  possible  by  sliding  down  inflated  slides  from  the  emergency  exits.

263207702,GERMAN NO TO ATAROT,"  BONN:  The  German   government  has  not  yet  replied  officially  to  Israel’s  compromise  proposal  on  the  Atarot  Airport  dispute,  officials  in  Jerusalem  said  recently.

263193859,German volunteers,"  German  volunteers   By  MYRA  NOVECK/Jerusalem  Post  Reporter   “OUR  volunteers  come  because  they  feel  responsibility  for  the  his  tory  of  our  country  and  a  responsibil  ity  for  the  future  of  our  country.  We  want  to  push  for  the  development  of  reconciliation  and  peace,”  says  20  year-old  Christianna  Dahm  of  Col  ogne,  a  volunteer  for  Action  for  Reconciliation  and  Peace  Services,  a  group  of  young  Germans  whose  goal  is  to  encourage  reconciliation  be  tween  Germany  and  countries  that   suffered  under  the  Nazis.   The  group  has  160  volunteers  in  nine  countries.  Nearly  a  quarter  of  the  volunteers  work  in  Israel.  The   idea  for  the  original  organization  came  out  of  a  discussion  by  German  Protestant  clergymen,  led  by  Lothar  Kreissig  in  the  late  Fifties,  who  “were  looking  for  a  way  to  overcome  the  problems  of  relations  between  Ger  mans  and  other  nations  as  a  result  of   the  war  and  the  Holocaust,”  says  Dahm.   In  Israel  the  organization  concen  trates  on  working  with  the  elderly  -  particularly  German-  and  Yiddish  speaking  persons  who  were  the   direct  victims  of  Nazism  -  as  well  as  with  handicapped  children.  Volun  teer  jobs  include  teching  extra  curricular  subjects,  tutoring,  work  in  homes  for  the  aged  and  home  visits  to  the  elderly.   Action  for  Reconciliation  is  an  18-month  programme,  although  a  West  German  law  just  passed  and  lengthening  army  service  will  mean   new  male  volunteers  will  in  future   participate  for  two  years  if  they  choose  to  join  the  Action  group  and  thus  fulfil  their  national  service  re   quirement  as  an  alternative  to  army  service.  The  programme  begins  with   a  one-month  seminar  in  West   Gemany,  which  includes  visits  to  concentration  camps,  work  in  the  camp  museums  and  discussions  with   former  inmates.   The  volunteers  then  go  to  the  country  of  their  choice.  The  Israeli  contingent  spends  the  first  three  months  in  a  work-language-study  programme  on,  a  kibbutz  before  being  sent  to  serve  in  institutions   around  the  country.  In  most  cases,  the  institution  provides  room  and  board,  and  sometimes,  pocket  money.  If  it  can’t  afford  that  and  Action  officials  think  it’s  important  enough,  the  organization  foots  the  bill,  but  resources  are  limited.   Two-thirds  of  the  organization’s  national  budget  comes  from  private   donations.   The  volunteers  say  they  rarely  encounter  anti-German  feeling  here,  although  they  say  earlier  groups  had  more  problems,  and   some  kibbutzim  still  refuse  to  take  German  volunteers.  On  the  other   hand,  many  of  the  elderly  with  whom  they  work  feel  more  comfort  able  speaking  German  than  Hebrew  and  still  feel  an  attachment  to  Ger  man  culture.   “it’s  the  second  generation  that  is  more  of  a  problem,”  says  28-year   old  Einat  Weiss,  housemother  at  a  seminar  centre  serving  the  volun  teers,  who  explains  that  the  Israeli  born  children  of  refugees  or  Holo  caust  survivors  see  only  the  negative  side  of  Germany  while  the  parents  remember  “another”  Germany.   Ironically,  Israel’s  economic   crunch  has  made  it  harder  for  the  Germans  to  find  suitable  volunteer  work.   Apart  from  having  contact  with  kibbutz  members,  the  volunteers  also  spend  weekends  with  city  fami   lies.   “You  get  to  know  a  country  and  the  people  get  to  know  you  and  maybe  after  that  they’ll  think  a  little  differently,”  says  volunteer  Bern  hard  Rohrbacher,  20,  from  Bonn.  That’s  the  sigh  of  reconciliation',  adds  Dahm.  “It’s  small  steps  and   hard  work.”",1985-11-14T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/263193859,“OUR volunteers come because they feel responsibility for the history of our country and a responsibility for the future of our country.

261454325,GERMAN CRIME,"  GERMAN  CRIME   TEL  AVIV  (UPI):  About  350  Israeli  women  are  working  as  prostitutes  in  West  Germany  and  about  400  young  Israelis  are  serving  time  in  German  prisons  on  drug-related  charges,  the  Jerusalem  Post  reported  last   week.   The  newspaper  said  the  figures  were  cited  by  Herut  Lapid,  head  of  the  Kibbutz  Movement  Criminal  Rehabilitation  Department,  following  a  recent  visit  to  West  Germany,  where  he  met  with  prisoners  and  law  enforcement  officials.   According  to  Lapid,  there  are  many  more  Israeli  women  working  as  prostitutes  in  Germany  besides  the  350  registered   with  the  authorities.

261645464,German Jews,"  German  Jews   IN  ADDITION  to  the  review  on  the  great  Heine  (AJN  18/11),  per  mit  me  to  add  the  following.  The  first  German-language  Free  School  for  Jews  was  opened  in  Berlin  by  David  Friedlaender  in  1778  the  aim  being  the  replace  ment  of  Yiddish,  still  the  vernac  ular  of  the  Jewish  people,  by  the  German  language.  This  was  rapidly  followed  by  Reform  Schools  all  over  Germany   whereby  many  Jews  turned  to  li  terature.  Literary  salons  sprang  up  in  Berlin.   A  member  of  such  a  cultural  centre  was  Henriette  Herz,  a  well  educated  young  Jewish  woman  whose  salon  was  the  venue  of  cul  tured  people  —  Jewish  and  non  Jewish  —  exchanging  ideas  and  literary  talk.  Moses  Mendelsohn’s  daughter  Doro  thea  Veit,  Rachel  Varnhagen  von  Ense  and  also  Heinrich  Heine  vis  ited  the  salon.  The  aforemen  tioned  were  the  most  famous  Jewish  women  of  that  era  and  like  Heinrich  Heine,  by  dint  of  ne  cessity,  converted  to  Christianity.   Heinrich  Heine,  the  gifted  poet  and  writer,  following  his  uni  versity  education  and  obtaining  a  degree  in  law,  reluctantly  con  verted  to  Protestantism  since  Civil  Service  careers  were  still  bar  red  to  Jews.  Never  practising  law,  his  fame  as  writer  and  poet  had  already  been  established.  He  wrote  biting  satires  on  the  Ger  man  Parliament,  which  landed  him  in  grave  conflict  with  the  Ger  man  authorities.  He  .chose  exile  in  Paris,  married  a  simple  unedu  cated  country  girl,  and  lived  there  the  rest  of  his  life.  Heine  died  in  1856.   It  was  only  in  the  year  1926  that  Heines  memorial  was  com  pleted  in  Hamburg’s  City  Park,  but  in  1933  Hitler  destroyed  Heine’s  monument  due  to  the  poet’s  innate  Jewishness.  Never  theless  Heine’s  German  songs,  especially  the  lovely  “Lorelei”  be  came  so  popular  that  the  Nazis  were  obliged  to  include  them  in  anthologies  albeit  labelling  them  “Author  Unknown!’  In  1981,  a  col  lection  was  made  for  a  new  me  morial  which  was  to  be  cast  in  bronze.

261460417,GERMAN JUSTICE,"  GERMAN  JUSTICE   WASHINGTON  (UPI):  President  Reagan  told  the  mother  of  slain  navy  diver  Robert  Stethem  that  he  is  satisfied  “justice  will  be  done”  in  the  prosecution  of  accused  hijacker-murderer  Mohammed  Ali  Hamadei.   “I  am  confident  the  German  Government  will  fulfil  its  inter   national  legal  obligations  and  Hamadei  wfll  get  the  justice  he  deserves,”  Reagan  told  Stethem’s  mother,  Patricia,  in  a  telephone  call.   The  call  came  as  the  west  German  Government  an  nounced  its  decision  to  not  ex  tradite  Hamadei  to  the  United  States  to  stand  trial  for  the  murder  of  Robert  Stethem  and  the  hijacking  of  a  TWA  jetliner  two  years  ago.   Instead,  Hamadei  will  be  tried  in  West  Germany  on  murder  and  air  piracy  charges  arising  from  the  hijacking,  as  well  as  un  related  charges  of  possess  ing  explosives  when  arrest  ed  January  13  at  Frankfurt  Airport.   Patricia  Stethem,  in  an  earli  er  appearance  on  the  NBC  “lb  day”  program,  said  her  fami-a  ly  was  “devastated”  by  the  ex-""   tradition  decision  ana  added,  “we  really  feel  that  not  enough  pressure  was  enforced  by  our  government  to  bring  Hamadei   here”.   White  House  spokesman  Marlin  Fltzwater  told  reporters  that  Reagan  telephoned  Stethem’s  mother  following  be  ing  informed  of  her  comments.   “V\fe  have  made  every  effort  to  ensure  justice  in  the  prose  cution  of  the  hijacker  Hamadei,”  he  quoted  Reagan  as  saying.  “I  nave  the  per  sonal  assurances  of  (West  Ger  man)  Chancellor  (Helmut)  Kohl  that  justice  will  be  done.   The  ChanceDor  has  told  us  that   there  will  be  no  deal  and  they  will  not  grant  him  clemency.”   Reagan  told  Stethem  that  U.S.  officials  are  co   operating  with  Wfest  German   authorities  on  evidence  in   the  hijacking  case  ‘‘to  see  that  tney  get  all  they  need   for  a  conviction”.   The  United  States,  which  hailed  Hamadei’s  arrest  as  a  blow  against  terrorism,  had  pressed  for  months  for  his  ex  tradition  and  a  trial  on  Ameri  can  soil.  The  Wfest  German  de  cision  represented  a  rebuff  to  Reagan,  who  discussed  the  matter  with  Kohl  just  two  weeks  ago  at  the  economic  summit  in  Italy.   For  the  record,  however,  the  administration  expressed  satisfaction  with  what  Fitz  water  called  “repeated  assur  ances”  that  “the  charges  brought  against  Hamadei  will  be  speedy,  vigorous,  complete  and  to  the  full  extent  or  the  law”.   “VAfe  are  confident  that  the  rule  of  law  will  prevail  in  this  case,  as  it  has  on  numerous  occasions,”  he  added.   In  her  televised  interview,  Stethem  voiced  concern  that  Hamadei  could  be  tried,  con  victed  and  sentenced,  then  later  set  free  by  VAfest  Germa  ny  -  perhaps  in  a  trade  for   two  Wfest  German  business  men  held  in  Lebanon,  whose  fates  were  believed  by  many  to   have  influenced  the  extradition  decision  in  Bonn.",1987-07-03T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/261460417,WASHINGTON (UPI): President Reagan told the mother of slain navy diver Robert Stethem that he is satisfied “justice will be done” in the prosecution of accused hijacker-murderer Mohammed Ali Hamadei.,https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article261460417?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1980-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1989-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The Australian Jewish News (Melbourne, Vic. : 1935 - 1999)",135.08932495117188,very relevant

213734006,German Feminist Films,"  German  Feminist  Films   For  Australian  women  making  films,  reliant  on  grant  monies  and  the  non-  theatrical  market  for  distribution,  the  experience  of  West  German  feminist  film  makers  provides  an  interesting  com  parison.  The  films  brought  together  by  the   Goethe  Institute  and  screened  in  a  series  of  programs  across  Australia  recently  were,  by  and  large,  made  with  money  from  television  and  the  guarantee  of  T.V.  exposure.  As  Dr  Jutta  Brueckner,  the  film  maker  who  accompanied  the  tour  explains  (see  interview),  the  films  presented  are  not  typical  or  representative  of  the  body  of  West  German  women's  film  production.  No  short  films  appeared  in  the  program,  for  example.  But  the  collection  did  reveal  an  en  couraging  diversity  of  styles  and  sub  ject  matter,  linked  by  the  common  theme  of  alienation  both  from  the  prevailing  image  of  woman  and  from  confining'  mores.  Do  Right  and  Fear  No  One  is  the  earlier  of  Brueckners  two  films.  When  she  began  it  she  knew  next  to  nothing  about  the  mechanics  of  making  a  film,  but  a  great  deal  about  her  protagonist,  Gerda  Siepenbrink  (Jutta's  mother),  the  kind  of  lower  middle  class  woman  who  grew  up  after  World  War  1  and  matured  during  the  Nazi  era.  From  a  fatherless  and  hence  poor  family,  Gerda  was  raised  in  an  even  more  relentlessly  conformist  environment  than  her  peers.  Her  mother  didn't  want  people  to  say  her  daughters  ran  wild  for  want  of  paternal  control,  so  they  were  kept  at  home,  sewing,  during  their  non-working  hours.  When  the  insurance  money  for  her  husband's  death  arrived  Gerda's  mother,  short  of  funds  for  daily  necessities,  in  vested  it  in  a  good  family  burial  plot.  JBeyond  every  other  consideration,  res:  pectability  was  the  most  important  human  achievement  in  her  eyes,  and  this  rite  instilled  in  her  daughters.   Brueckner  constructed  the  film  of  animated  still  photographs  combined  with  Gerda  narrating  the  richly  ironic  soundtrack  in  a  curiously  deadpan  fashion,  perhaps  still  unaware  of  the  ab  surdity  of  investing  in  death  in  the  midst  of  life.  The  opening  section  of  the  film  uses  the  photographs  of  August  Sander  who  attempted,  in  his  work,  to  construct  a  composite  portrait  of  Germany  during  the  pre-war  years  and  whose  work  was  subsequently  banned  and  burned  by  the  Nazis.  There  is  very  little  camera  move  ment  in  this  section,  with  each  image  replacing  the  next  at  a  measured  pace.  The  photographs  are  of  different  people  and  unrelated  to  the  narration  except  in  so  far  as  Gerda  is  representative  of  many  of  her  country  men  and  women  of  the  era.  When  the  protagonist  begins  to  develop  a  personality  based  less  on  her  background  and  more  on  .her  consider  ation  of  the  forces  that  have  shaped  her  life,  her  own  image  takes  the  place  of  the  historic  photographs.  As  she  takes  on  a  more  challenging  job,  the  pace  of  the  images  quickens,  climaxing  in  her  dis  covery  that  her  husband  has  been  seeing  another  woman,  which  is  illustrated  by  a  rapid  series  of  blurred  images,  conveying  the  uncontrollable  fury  of  a  woman  wronged.  A  portrait  of  both  a  generation  and  one  woman  plodding  towards  emanci  pation,  Do  Right  and_  Fear  No  One  ex  presses  a  gently  guarded  optimism  about  the  possibilities  for  change  within  a  life  time.  But  what  happens  when  the  con  ventions  and  expectations  are  gone?  Brueckner  looks  at  a  contemporary  Gerda  -  Rita  Rischak  —  in  her  second  film,  A  Totally  Neglected  Girl  (subtitled  How  Low  Can  a  Girl  Sink?).  Like  Gerda,  Rita  is  real,  this  time  one  of  the  film  maker's  best  friends.  She  lives  with  her  righteous  and  oider-obsessed  parents  and  her  five-   year-old  illegitimate  son.  But  the  location  and  particulars  aside,  Rita  could  be  any  one  and  the  persistent  self-hatred  she  espouses,  combined  with  half-formed  dreams  of  a  glamorous  (or  at  least  self-  fulfilling)  existence,  must  be  familiar  to  many  many  women.  Although  the  men  in  her  life  are  ciphers,  vapid  and  transient,  (including  the  one  who  has  fathered  her  son)  and  she  no  longer  bothers  hiding  her  con  tempt  for  them,  she  still  expects  one  per  fect  specimen  to  turn  up  and  wisk  her  away  from  her  drab  life  into  a  fantasy  world  of  love,  beauty,  motherhood  and  eternal  youth.  Rita's  tussle  between  dreams  and  reality  is  played  out  over  one  day  in  her  life,  one  on  which  she  has  to  find  a  new  job  or  tell  her  parents  how  she  had  to  leave  her  old  one.  For  its  sheer  hopelessness,  A  Totally  Neglected  Girl  is  a  frightening  film,  salvaged  from  complete  despair  by  the  heroine's  witty  perceptions  of  her  pre  dicament  combined  with  her  spunk  in   the  lace  ot  the  wall  of  conformity  around  her.  In  An  All  Round  Reduced  Personality,  Helke  Sanders  (not  to  be  confused  with  Helma  Sanders,  director  of  Heinrich  and  Shirrin's  Wedding)  examines  another  di  mension  of  encirclement.  She  juxtaposes  a  personality  under  seige  with  a  city,  Berlin,  similarly  surrounded.  Edda  Chiemnykewski  (played  by  Sanders  herself);  mother,  lover,  freelance  photojournalism  and  member  of  a  women's  photographic  project,  juggles  a  myriad  of  daily  demands  on  her  time  while  trying  to  remain  herself,  a  growing  personality.  The  film's  title  derives  from  a  slogan,  ""the  all-round  realised  socialist  person  ality""  broadcast  on  East  German  radio.  Disenchanted  with  both  east  and  west,  and  caught  geographically  between  the  two,  Edda's  attention  focuses  instead  on  the  thousands  of  minor  issues  and  irrit  ations  that  make  up  an  individual's  ex  istence  and  on  the  integration  of  the  personal  and  the  political.  The  two  come  together  when  the  women's  photography  group  is  asked  to  prepare  a  photographic  exhibition  de  picting  Berlin  from  a  woman's  viewpoint.   The  view  turns  out  to  be  less  conform-  ingly  female  than  the  city  fathers  had  hoped,  illustrating,  very  gently,  that  women  are  people  too.  An  All  Round  Reduced  Personality  is  a  disarmingly  low-key  film,  riddled  with  cynicism  but  never  bleak,  and  shot  with  a  documentary  feel.  The  single  true  documentary  in  the  collection  is,  by  contrast,  a  dramatised  re-enactment  of  a  woman's  experiences  as  a  battered  wife,  and  what  she  does  about  it.  The  Power  of  Men  is  the  Patience  of  Women  (Cristina  Perincioli)  fuses  the  experiences  of  several  women  who  found  their  way  to  a  Berlin  women's  refuge  to  create  the  central  character,  Addi.  Addi  endures  a  violent  husband  be  cause  of  her  economic  dependence  on  him.  Their  young  son,  increasingly  dis  turbed  by  events  at  home  and  sent  home  by  his  kindergarten  because  of  his  anti  social  behaviour,  heightens  her  isolation.   When  she  sees  a  documentary  about  a  women's  refuge  on  television  she  simply  calls  a  cab  and  leaves  without  turning  off  the  set.  The  film  does  not  moralise,  or  even  accuse.  Nor  does  it  fall  into  the  trap  of  portraying  the  villain  as  a  self-propelled  ogre.  Susceptible  to  violent  outbursts  and  alternately  cruel  and  then  concerned.  Addi's  husband  is  himself  the  product  of  an  uncaring  background  -  an  adult  version  of  what  his  son  is  well  on  the  way  to  becoming.  Though  the  refuge,  to  which  Addi  eventually  escapes,  is  presented  as  a  sal  vation,  the  film  in  general  avoids  a  tone  of  grating  self-congratulation  that  some  times  characterises  feminist  documentaries  about  the  movement's  achievements.  Staff  of  the  Paddington  Town  Hall,  where  these  films  were  shown  in  Sydney,  tell  of  a  man  who  periodically  comes  in  to  enquire  about  screenings  by  the  Gothic  Institute.  What  he  probably  has  in  mind  are  films  like  Elfi  Mikesch's  I  Often  Think  of  Hawaii  and  Ulrike  Ottinger's  Madam  X  —  an  Absolute  Dictator,  two  murky  ex  amples  of  supposedly  feminist  aesthetic.  I  Often  Think  of  Hawaii  is  a  stulti  fying  boring  film  about  the  stultifying  boring  lives  led  by  people  forced  to  live  in  housing  estates  and  work  at  lousy,  repetitive,  poorly-paid  jobs.  Mikesch  focuses  most  of  her  attention  on  the  pipe-dreams  of  one  such  family  -   turning  her  subjects  into  objects  of  in  tellectual  curiosity  fop  the  well-educated.  Films  such  as  this  echo  Martin  Nicklaus'  celebrated  remarks  about  sociologists:  Professional  palms  turned  upwards  and  professional  eyes  cast  downwards.  They  should  be  viewed  as  a  sort  of  cinematic  colonialism  and  do  nothing  to  advance  the  cause  of  feminism  or  anything  else.  In  Madame  X,  Ulrike  Ottinger  indulges  in  another  kind  of  feminist  myth-making,  with  a  141  minute  endurance  test  that  owes  a  lot  to  Lord  of  the  Flies.  Ottinger  has  gathered  together  seven  women  repre  senting  seven  different  female  stereotypes,  put  them  out  to  sea  on  a  junk  and  left  them  to  it.  Meanwhile  she  experiments  with  a  variety  of  encounters  and  camera  angles  which  are  supposed  to  prove  (I  think)  that  we  are  all  trapped  by  the  past  and  forging  a  new  society  is  going  to  be  a  lot  more  difficult  than  Utopians  imagine.  Most  of  the  budget  for  this  film  appears  to  have  been  squandered  by  the  art  department  and,  in  particular,  on  some  wonderfully  lavish  costumes.  The  rest  of  the  production  is  an  obscure  celebration  of  the  amateurish  which,  had  it  been  directed  by  a  man,  would  not  have  rated  a  showing.   What,  for  me,  is  confusing  about  these  films  is  that  they  seem  to  have  so  little  in  common  with  the  films  of  men  like  Herzog,  Wenders,  Fassbinder  and  Haupt  that  have  been  shown  here  and  it  is  not  enough  to  say  defiantly  that  women  make  films  differently  from  men.  The  aest-known  contemporary  German  films  have  a  sense  of  self-assurance.  These  films,  by  and  large,  do  not.  People  steeped  in  the  Australian  feminist  film  tradition  also  will  find  very  little  in  these  films  with  which  they  would  feel  familiar.  Australian  women's  films  seem  to  have  a  sense  of  purpose  -  conflicting  purpose  often  —  but  purpose  nonetheless.  By  contrast,  these  German  women's  films  have  a  strong  grasp  of  the  flaws  in  the  present,  know  exactly  what  was  wrong  with  the  past  and  have  almost  nothing  to  say  about  the  future.

Provis  blamed  her  mental  approach  for  her  slow  start  to  the  game  as  well  as  for  her  strong  finish.   .  i  often  seem  to  go  out  there  and  find  myself  down  1-6  and  suddenly  wake  up  and  realise  I'd  better  do  something,""  she  said.   .  ""In  the  last  few  games  I  knew  I  had  to  keep  calm  and  take  a  bit  of  pace  off  my  serve.   ""My  arm  was  starting  to  shake  toward  the  finish/but  in  the  end  she  made  the  mistakes.""   Provis  is  the  first  Australian  woman  since  Diane  Balestrat  and  Wendy  Turnbull  in  1980  to  go  beyond  the  third  round  of  the  French  Open.   It  is  also  a  personal  highlight  for  Provis  who  has  never  been  beyond  the  third  round  in  a   Grand  Slam  tournament,  having  been  beaten  at  that  stage  in  the  US  Open  last  year.   ■  Second  seed  Martina  Navratilova,  who  has  been  going  to  Paris  for  15  years  without  ever  finding  an  opportunity  to  see  the  Mona  Lisa,  gave  herself  ample  time  for  sightseeing  with  her  brisk  victory  at  the  French  Open  championships  yesterday.   The  31-year-old  player,  who  is  twice  former  champion  and  also  runner-up  in  each  of  the  past  three  years,  reached  the  last  16  with  a  6-2,  6-2  victory  over  Austrian  Barbara  Paulus  in  50  minutes  of  dazzling  tennis  on  the  centre  court  at  Roland  Garros.   Watched  by  actress/singer  Liza  Minelli,  Navratilova  produced  her  own  one-woman  cabaret  against  a  more  than  competent  17  year-old  opponent  who  is  among  a  band  of  fine  players  emerging  from  Austria  at  the   present  time.   Throughout  the  five  days  of  the  champion  ship,  Navratilova  has  continually  stressed  her  belief  that  she  remains  the  best  player  in  the  world,  despite  the  claims  of  reigning  French  and  Australian  champion  and  official  world  No  1,  Steffi  Graf.   Her  argument  is  open  to  question,  but  Na  vratilova  has  dropped  only  seven  games  in  three  matches  —  though  second-round  oppo  nent  Hellas  Ter  Riet  of  the  Netherlands  pul  led  out  through  illness  at  6-0,  1-0  —  and  her  powers  appear  undiminished.   Tomorrow  her  opponent  for  a  place  in  the  quarter-finals  will  be  the  13th-seeded  Russian  Natalia  Zverva.  Zverva  was  world  junior  champion  in  1987  when  she  won  the  French,  U.S.  and  Wimbledon  events  for  that  age.   Zverva,  as  American  as  Chris  Evert  in  ap  pearance  with  her  blonde  ponytail  arid  dou  ble-fisted  backhand,  thrashed  Melissa  Gurney  of  the  US  6-0,6-4  on  No  2  court.   Two  other  women's  seeds  won  with  vary  ing  degrees  of  discomfort.   Sixth-ranked  Helena  Sukova,  of  Czechoslo  vakia,  dropped  eight  games  to  wily  claycourt  ""  specialist  Mercedes  Paz,  of  Argentina,..and  West  German  Sylvia  Hanika-had  even  more  trouble  in  subduing  French  number  two  Isa  belle  Demongeot  in  a  three-hour  war  of  attri  tion  on  the  centre  court.   Hanika  won  3-6,  7-5,6-4  without  ever  gain  ing  totally  ascendancy  over  a  gritty  opponent  who  thoroughly  deserved  the  rousing  ovation  she  was  granted  by  the  centre-court  crowd.  .   Sukova  went  through  6-4,6-4.

263224275,GERMAN-ISRAELI RELATIONSHIP,"  L   GERMAN-ISRAELI  RELATIONSHIP   To  the  Editor  of  The  Jerusalem  Post   Sir,  -1  refer  to  Susan  Hattis  Rolef  s  review  (February  7)  of  Lily  Gard  ner’s  book,  Special  relationship  be  tween  West  Germany  and  Israel  -  a  highly  interesting  and  extremely   well-documented  book  which  merits  the  attention  of  all  people  of  good  will,  especially  among  the  younger  generations  in  Israel  and  West  Ger  many.   I  am  somewhat  disturbed  by  some  of  Ms.  Rolefs  unfounded  judge  ments  concerning  the  German  youn  ger  generation  and  its  attitude  to  wards  Israel.   Having  worked  for  a  number  of  years  in  the  field  of  bilateral  youth  exchanges  between  Israel  and  West  Germany,  I  cannot  accept  the  allega  tion  that  the  “German  post-war  gen  eration...  is  not  committed  to  sup  port  Israel.  Some  tend  even  to   associate  it  with  Fascism.”   It  is  quite  true  that  there  has  been  a  remarkable  (and  necessary)  change  of  attitudes  towards  Israel  since  1967/68  among  the  politically  interested  young  people  in  Ger  many,  but  it  is  incorrect  to  describe  this  changement  in  terms  of  mere  anti-Semitism  and  anti-Zionism.  (Most  young  people  here  have  no   idea  what  Zionism  means  and  what   its  implications  are  for  the  Jewish  people.)   The  “intricate  network  of  rela   tions”  now  existing  between  our  two  countries  does  not  depend  solely  on  the  generation  born  before  World  War  II.  The  politically  responsible  younger  generation  in  all  democratic  parties  of  the  Federal  Republic  sup  port  the  uniqueness  of  the  German  Israeli/Jewish  relationship  without  agreeing  with  each  and  every  politic   al  move  of  the  Israeli  or  West  Ger  man  government.   We  wanted  critical  and  concerned  citizens  -  now  we  have  some  in  both  our  countries,  let  them  meet.  They   are  better  than  those  so-called   “friends  of  Israel”  with  a  Nazi  past   and  sometimes  a  less  democratic  present.   HARTWIG  BIERHOFF  Bonn.   Susan  Hattis  Rolef  comments:   I  am  certainly  well  aware  of  the  many  bilateral  youth  exchanges  be  tween  Israel  and  the  Federal  Repub  lic  of  Germany:  I  have  just  had  a  17-year  old  German  boy  from  Braunschweig  staying  in  my  home  for  10  days.  But  what  percentage  of  German  youth  is  involved  in  these  programmes?  Do  they  all  return  to  Germany  committed  to  the  pre  servation  of  the  “special”  rela  tionship  between  the  two  countries?  And  what  about  all  the  young  Ger  mans  who  have  greater  sympathy  for  the  Palestinians  and  regard  Israel  merely  as  an  occupier  and  oppres  sor,  the  sort  of  state  they  have  learned  to  despise  in  Anti   Faschismus  classes  at  school?   Undoubtedly,  a  large  number  of  highly  devoted  people  are  doing  marvellous  work  in  trying  to  im  prove  German-Jewish/Israeli  rela  tions.  I  myself  am  involved  in  this  process  on  many  levels.  However,  both  from  personal  exeprience  in  Germany  and  from  empirical  evi  dence,  I  am  not  as  optimistic  about   the  future  as  Dr.  Feldman  is  in  her  book.

261567754,German’s retried,"  German’s  retried   FRANKFURT:  The  retrial  opened  before  a  jury  here  of  three  German  physicians  charged  with  complicity  in  the  murder  of  thousands  of  mentally  handicapped  persons  under  the  Nazi  euthanasia  programme  in  1940  and  1941.   Dr  Aquilin  Ullrich,  71,  Dr  Heinrich  Bunke,  71,  and  Dr  Klaus  Endruweit,  72,  had  been  acquitted  on  this  same  charge  here  in   1967.   Proceedings  against  Dr  Endruweit  were  immediately  separated  from  the  rest  for  reasons  of  the  defendant’s  ill-health,  who  claimed  that  he  was  physically  unfit  to  stand  trial,  and  ask  ed  that  his  case  be  suspended.   Dr  Ullrfch  surprised  the  jury  with  the  same  plea,  but  the  court  declined  to  decide  in  his  favour,  pointing  at  medical  testimonies  submitted  last  autumn  saying  that  all  three  suspects  were  “fit  for  trial,”  provided  that  weekly  sessions  in  court  were  limited  to  a  maximum  three  hours.

In  a  land  where  dail\  newspapei  icpoiison  the  ""Demoniiiation  Front""  aie  nothing  umi-ual  there  is  only  one  detail  which  makes  this  radicular  encountei  between  police  tnd  protestors  at  all  remai  kable.  For  the  I  test-lime  Molotow  cocktails  (olten  containing  sugar  which  possesses  the  gruesome  piopei  t\  ol  adhering  to  human  skin  while  burning)  are  thrown.  With  this,  the  dashes  betw-eeœyoungGermans'  and  the  authorities  achieve  a  new  dimension.  A  deperalion  has  entered  the  attitudes  o(  the  German  \  outh  and  this  desperation  threatens  to  consume  them  a\  a  search  lor  identify  and  security  meets  with  very  little-success.  Unemployment  continues  to  grow,  the  state  is  in  debt,  multi-nationals  seek  to  inuease  assets,  K  of  all  school  children  are  considered  to-.be  ""disturbed,  ill  or  handicapped"",  Bonn  is  in  turmoil  with  Schmidt  lacing  the  prospect  ol  losing  power,  and  the  situation  in  Poland  becomes  increasingly  tense.  Such  aie  the  problems  confronting  the  youth  attempting  to  establish  foundations  ioi  the  luluie  ol  Gcimany.  Young  Germans  are  highly  aware  politically  and  conscious  ol  the  implications  ol  these  current  trends.  They  arc  not  trying  to  create  a  Utopian  society  but  instead  .an  environment  in  which  one  can  live  secuiely  with  the  knowledge  that  ones  efforts  are  at  least  worthwhile.  \  The  squatters  in  Beihn  want  a^efcl  over  theîi  heads,  a  commodity  which  is  very  di  city  acutely  short  of  space  ely  unable  to  come  up  with  only  path  of  action  a^Jltabl  empty  buildings  deemed  lor  object,  the  squatters  Buses  of  students  filk|  Marburg  in  West  Germa  support.

The  behaviour  of  the  youth  is  a  result  ol  many  lactors  and  is  full  of  just  as  many  contradictions.  The  economic  situation  of  the  country  is  very  oppressive.  Jobs  arc  scarce  and  opportunities  lor  the  individual  to  distinguish  him/  herself  rare.  In  post-war  Germany  effort  was  required  to  develop  the  shattered  economy  to  its  present  sophisticated  level.  But  today  most  potential  has  been  realized.  The  economy  can  not  really  progress  much  further  and  thus  the  future  for  young  school-leavers  and  students  looks  fairly  grim.  Tertiary  education  is  structured  differently  in  Germany  if  you  are  fortunate  enough  to  secuie  a  place  at  a  tertiary  institute  close  to  home,  you  are  faced  with  the  prospect  of  a  heavy,  long  course  based  purely  on  lectures  (no  tutorials)  and  in  most  cases,  the  lack  of  any  campus  life  whatsoever.  Some  courses  are  only  assessed  at  the  completion  of  study  and  the  rate  of  failure  is  predictably  high.  For  example,  Law  in  Munich  is  examined  for  the  first  time  at  the  end  of  a  five  year  course.  A  wide  generation  gap  exists  with  the  young  resenting  the  old  and  what  they  represent.  Since  the  war,  Germany  has  emerged  as  a  class-conscious,  materialistic  society  and  the  young  condemn  their  elders  for  their  narrow-minded,  sedate  beliefs,  their  clinging  to  tradition  and  their  inability  to  come  to  terms  with  the  behaviour  of  their  frustrated,  lightened  children.  The  parents,  on  the  other  hand  are  intensely  proud  ol  what  they  have  achieved  since  the  war,  of  the  material  comforts  which  they  have  been  able  to  provide  their  childien  with  and  are  confused  and  hurl  by  this  criticism  and  rejection,  which  they  attribute  to  laziness  and  lack  ol  motivation.  Thc\  11.1  Use  to  ,u  knowledge  the  fear  which  possesses  mi  \oungei  guieialmn  as  this  would  be  a  confession  that  'hev  h.i\e  failed  in  then  paternal  iules.  Ina  loiwiliy  despeiale  to  assert  its  tolerance  Germans  are  very  concious  of  their  recent  history  many  examples  •niokianci  can  he  lound.  The  German  press,  for  can  adopt  Mich  an,  idealistic,  ""tolerant  '  approach  larkcs,  inaccurate,  coloured  reporting  {man!  are  very  outraged  at  the  .dhfciij*  accuslomcd  to  the  comr*c.h  of  the  Australian  press,  I  -o|5%iti-Souih  Africa  feelings.  The  experiences  of  a  South  Alrican  friend,  rejected  at  school  because  of  the  politics  of  her  country  and  unable  to  find  anyone  prepared  to  enter  into  friendship  or  even   ?   conversation  with  her  in  which  politics  played  no  great  role,  tend  to  illustiate  the  way  in  which  an  inflexible  condemnation  ol  human  injustices,  in  a  scarch  lor  political  idealism,  can  actually  result  in  human  injustices.  Young  Germans  are  certainly  intensely  committed  to  their  beliefs.  The  precariousness  ol  W.  Germany's  physical  situation  also  gives  rise  .to  much  fear.  Almost  tangible  was  the  réduction  in  tension  at  the  release  of  the  hostages  in  Teheran  and  the  dread  th.n  the  Russians  would  move  in  to  solve  the  ciisis  in  Poland  was  overwhelming.  The  vulnerability  of  his/her  land  is  rei.nf  orced  to  every  young  Get  man  particularly  to  the  males  laced  with  III  teen  months  of  compulsory  militai  y  service.  The  reality  ol  world  politics,  a  notion  with  which  Austuilians  are  seldom  confronted,  is  continually  leiniorced  by  the  piesence  ol  ""the  wall""  which  separates  the  peoples  ol  Germany  both  actually  and  symbojkallv.  Mo;,t  young  Germans  h  ave  idatives  in  the  east  whom  they  have  nevei  met  and  whose  existence  is  a  great  source  ol  grief  and  guill  It  is  this  sense  ol  inadequacy  which  I  consider  to  be  the  souice  ol  the  tear  jnd  consequent  violent,  destructive  behavioui  ol  the  Geiman  youth  the  demon^nations,  rioting  and  vandalism  are  simply  manifestations  of  a  hideous  feeling  ol  ineflectuality,  in  political,  weial  and  economic  teims.  Germany  sits  in  the  middle  ol  turope,  caught  between  the  USSR  and  the  USA,  struggling  to  compete  with  more  powerful  nations  for  trade,  witnessing  social  injustices  and  unable  to  do  a  thing.  According  to  the  experiences  ol  the  young  in  Germany,  moderate,  rational  behaviour  achieves  nothing.  .  .  .  With  300,000  applicants  to  emmigiate  to  Auslialia  registered  in  198I,  it  seeim  many  are  reluctant  to  experience  lit  si  hand  what  the  luture  holds  lor  W.  Germany.

On  Saturday,  East  Germany  agreed  to  the  exodus  after  a  re  markable  accord  between  Soviet  bloc  and  Western  nations  ended  a  deadlock  that  forccd  many  of  the  refugees  to  spend  weeks  camping  outside  the  embassies.   The  first  train  carrying  East  Germans  who  had  sought  refuge  in  the  West  German  embassy  in  Prague  arrived  in  the  Bavarian  city  of  Hof  at  6.14am.  Several  hundred  local  residents  who  gathered  to  greet  the  newcomers  applauded  as  the  train  pulled  in   to  the  station.   Well-wishers  handed  out  bot  tles  of  wine,  champagne  and  fruit  .  as  the  East  Germans  got  off  the   train.   Jorg  Hauschild,  who  travelled  with  his  wife,  Veronica,  and  three  children,  said:  ""We're  so  very  happy  to  be  here,  but  we're   so  tired.""   Uwc  Kucster,  34,  an  engineer  from  Cottbus,  said  he  decided  to  leave  East  Germany  after  being  harassed  by  authoritios^forapply  'Mg'tb  leave  the  country  legally.   ""We  had  no  future  there,""  he  said  as  he  hugged  his  wife.  ""We  ...had^'asflat,  we  didn!t  live  badly.   But  it^was  like  we  were  living  behind  a  big  mountain  that  we'd  never  get  over.""   •  The  agreement  announced  on  Saturday  covered  some  3500  East  Germans  who  began  crowd  ing  into  the  embassy  in  Prague  several  weeks  ago  and  more  than  800  East  Germans  at  the  embassy  in  Warsaw,  Poland.   The  accord  and  its  details  were  announced  by  officials  in  West  Germany,  East  Germany,  Czechoslovakia  and  Poland.   On  arriving  in  Hof,  many  of  the  refugees  quickly  made  their  way  to  a  bank  of  telephone  booths  in  the  station  in  mostly  futile  efforts  to  reach  relatives  in  East  Germany.   Most  had  little  or  no  West  German  money  and  the  few  who  did  faccd  constant  busy  signals   from  commynist  East  Germa  ny's  overtaxed  telephone  cir  cuits.   Amid  the  crush  on  the  plat  form,  station  loudspeakers  called  out  the  names  of  new  arrivals  who  had  relatives  waiting  for  them.  Officials  said  about  780  refugees  were  on  the  train.   In  Poland,  more  than  800  ref  ugees  boarded  an  East  German  train  that  left  Warsaw's  Eastern  Station  before  dawn  yesterday,   headed  for  the  West  German  bor-y  der  city  of  Helmstedt.

Some  of  the  refugees  had  spent  weeks  huddled  in  tents  and  on  cots  in  the  embassy  com  pound  amid  growing  crowding,  spreading  disease  and  worsening   weather.   East  Germany,  which  had  harshly  criticised  Hungary  for  al  lowing  a  similar  refugee  exodus,  said  it  granted  the  transfer  as  a  ""humanitarian  act"".  .   7  Horst  Wafierischmidt,'.a~state""   secretary  in  the  federal  Interior  Ministry,  said  Bonn  had  not  paid  ,  to  secure  passage  for  the  refugees.

In  a  number  of  cities,  police  cars  and  motorcycles  patrolled  with  black  mourning  ribbons  fluttering  from  radio  aerials  as  officers  mani  fested  grief  and  anger  at  the  kill  ings.

A  big  manhunt  was  launched  for  the  killer  or  killers.  Police  ar  rested  a  man  yesterday  after  find  ing  a  9mm  pistol,  of  the  type  used  in  Monday  night's  killings,  at  his   home.   They  said  the  weapon  had  been  stolen  from  a  police  officer  during  an  anti-nuclear  demonstration  in  1986.   The  murders,  the  first  of  police  on  demonstration  duties  in  West  Germany,  were  condemned  by  all  political  parties.  Members  of  Chancellor  Kohl's  Christian  Dem  ocrats  renewed  demands  for  legis  lation  to  ban  the  wearing  of  masks  by  demonstrators.   About  3500  police  officers  marched  in  Hamburg,  3000  in  West  Berlin  and  a  similar  number  in  Duesseldorf.  Other  rallies  were  staged  in  Bonn,  Kassel,  Koblenz,  Dortmund,  Bremen,  Mainz,  Lud   wigshafen,  and  Kaiserslautern.

102040432,German tennis unwinds,"  Picture:  Rauler   Larry  Robinson,  of  the  Montreal  Canadiens,  catches  a  high  stick  in  the  face  from  from  Brad  McCrimmon,  of  the  Calgary  Flames,   during  first  period  action  at  Calgary.  The  Canadiens  won  4-3.   German  tenuis  unwinds   By  DAVID  IRVINE   Never  before  have  the  Germans,  a  nation  with  no  great  tradition  in  tennis,  known  such  success  as   in  1988.   Apart  from  his  Davis  Cup  heroics,  Boris  Becker  was  a  worthy  winner  of  the  Masters  while,  on  ¡he  women's  front,  Steffi  Graf  recorded  only  the  third  Grand  Slam  of  all  time  —  then  burnished  it  with  Olympic  gold.   Since  Becker's  first  Wimbledon  triumph  at  17,  the  number  of  players  throughout  West  Germany  is  said  to  have  doubled  to  over  two  million.   Yet  still  the  feeling  persists  that,  though  the  personalities  are  projected,  the  game  itself  remains  a  lesser  relation  of  soccer  and  even  handball.   Many  believe  —  and  perhaps  with  good  reason  —  that  Becker  and  Graf  will  do  even  better  next  year.  If  they  do,  their  impact  through  television  will  again  be  limited.  Already  it  seems  the  main  channels  will  be  priced  out  of  the  Wimbledon  market.  West  Germans,  it  seems,  are  still  not  con  vinced  that  Becker  and  Graf  are  the  sort  of  catalyst  Björn  Borg  was  to  a  generation  of  Swedes.   ""Here  in  Sweden,""  they  observe,  ""tennis  is  avail  able  for  all.  In  Germany  people  are  still  priced   out.""   They  also  say  —  and  the  evidence  tends  to  support  them  —  that  even  someone  as  talented  as  Carl-Uwe  Steeb,  who  made  the  cup  triumph  possi  ble  by  beating  Mats  Wilander,  prefers  the  comfort  of  the  Bundesliga,  where  sponsorship  can  bring  lucrative  rewards,  to  the  competitive  demands  of   the  circuit.   League  tennis,  which  extends  the  clay-court  sea  son,  has  been  the  bane  of  a  succession  of  West  German  national  coaches.  A  decade  ago  Rolf  Gehring  and  Uli  Pinner  were  among  Europe's  best,  but  they  never  sought  to  prove  it  on  a  world-wide   stage.   In  Becker  and  Graf,  though,  their  nation  has  been  blessed  with  two  superstars  possessing  an  insatiable  appetite  for  success.  Becker  says  he  is  ready  to  lift  his  game  to  a  new  level.   ""Now  I  have  a  pretty  good  backhand  and  a  better  volley.  But  it's  more  that  my  approach  has  changed.  I'm  taking  it  more  seriously  than  before.""   Since  losing  to  Stefan  Edberg  in  this  year's  Wim  bledon  final  —  his  greatest  disappointment  in  1988  —  Becker  has  been  beaten  onlj  twice.  From  April  to  December,  Graf  lost  just  once.  ""But  we  both  like  winning,""  he  grins  as  if  in  explanation.   Though  Becker  made  his  mark  first,  it  is  Grafs   influence  which  is  perhaps  more  apparent.  A  re  cent  survey  showed  that  German  girls  arc  as  eager  to  play  like  her  as  Americans  are  to  follow  Chris  Evert's  example.  As  not  one  Evert  clone  has  suc  ceeded  since  Tracy  Austin  and  Andrea  Jaeger  ""re  tired  hurt""  this  could  mean  that  if  Evert  and  Martina  Navratilova  choose  to  quit  —  which  may  well  happen  during  the  next  two  years  —  European  domination  of  the  women's  game  will  be  almost  complete.  Graf,  who  hits  her  ground  strokes  with  such  ferocity,  has  little  to  fear  from  the  game's  base-liners  and  has  shown,  increasingly,  that  the  forecourt  holds  no  terrors  for  her.   Becker,  who  raised  some  eyebrows  in  New  York  recently  by  declaring  that  clay  was  his  favourite  surface,  has  emerged  as  a  genuine  all-court  compet  'itor  over  the  past  year  —  and  seems  more  deter  mined  than  ever  to  match  Gottfried  von  Cramm,  the  only  German  ever  to  win  the  French  title.   Von  Cramm  won  the  French  twice,  was  run  ner-up  three  times  at  Wimbledon  and  once  at  Forest  Hills,  and  was  twice  US  doubles  champion  with  Henner  Henkel.  Few  doubt  Becker  can  im  prove  on  that.  For  Graf  a  unique  second  successive  Grand  Slam  in  1989  is  the  immediate  goal.   —  Guardian",1988-12-31T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/102040432,"Never before have the Germans, a nation with no great tradition in tennis, known such success as in 1988.

Their  problems  -  were  not  unlike  those  faced  by  people  escaping  from  other  parts  of  war-time  Europe,  he  said.   Professor  Waller  was   speaking  at  the  launching  of  a  book  “Community  of  Fate”  by  Dr  John  Foster  in  B’nai   B’rith  House.   The  function  was  organised  jointly  by  the  Victorian  B’nai  B’rith  Council  and  the   publishers  Allen  and  Unwin   Australia.   The  book  contains  essays  by  14  members  of  the  communi  ty  who  fled  Germany  in  Wbrld  War  II  and  settled  in  Melbourne.   Professor  Whller  said  the   query  on  where  do  I  come  from  is  a  Jewish  question.   “Those  in  the  book  know,  and  knew,  from  whence  they   came.   “They  had  their  origins  in  various  parts  of  Germany.   “Where  am  I  is  another   Jewish  question  and  this  too  they  know.   “They  fled  to  what  to  all  in  tents  and  purposes  is  the  farthest  part  of  the  Jewish   world.   “Why  they  are  here  is  something  that  is  less  known.   INFLUENCE   “One  tiling  is  sure  -  Kristallnacht  had  its  effect  and  that  is  why  people  are   here.   “In  many  of  the  chapters,  there  is  a  feeling  of  how  un  just  the  situation  was.  V\fe  are  and  were  Germans  who  were  also  Jews.   “How  could  they  do  it  to  us  is  an  underlying  question,”  he   said.   Professor  Waller  said  in  many  of  the  chapters,  there  were  references  to  early  years  in  Melbourne  Jewry.   He  highlighted  the  memoir  by  Mrs  Suzie  Ehrmann  which  spoke  of  the  early  days  in  St  Kilda  Synagogue,  under  Rabbi  Jacob  Danglow,  where  while  the  order  of  service  was  not  unfamiliar,  the  atmosphere  and  attitude  towards  foreigners  was  cold.!   The  work  also  highlights  the  early  days  of  the  nearby  ""tem  ple  Beth  Israel  and  B’nai   B’rith.   “It  is  an  historical  document  which  has  been  given  substance  by  historical  expertise.   INSPIRED   Dr  Foster  in  his  address  to  the  function  thanked  the  14   individuals  who  had  agreed   to  share  their  memories  with  his  students  in  what   was  originally  a  research  assignment.   He  said  the  idea  for  the  book  had  come  from  discussion  with  Mr  Kurt  Lippmann  and  his  wife  Marion.   But  his  interest  in  Jews,  and  German  Jews  in  particular  had   come  much  earlier.   Dr  Foster  said  that  one  of  his  fondest  and  earliest  memories  of  a  world  other  than  his  own  Australian  Christian   background  had  come  from  German  Jewish  neighbours  in  a  block  of  flats  in  St  Kilda  when  he  was  two  or  three  years  old.   “I  was  attracted  by  the  friendship  and  the  exciting  ac   cents  and  owe  much  to  Ger  trude  and  Fred  Katz  who  were   those  neighbours,”  he  said.   Mrs  Katz  is  one  of  the  14   people  in  the  book.   Mr  Kurt  Rathner  (chairman,  B’nai  B’rith  Council,  Victoria)  who  chaired  the  evening,  said   B’nai  B’rith  is  not  a  German   organisation  but  open  to  all  sections  of  the  community.   “If  a  book  is  written  about  any  other  section  of  Melbourne  or  Australian  Jewry,  B’nai  B’rith  gladly   would  be  associated  with  that   launching  too,”  he  said.",1986-07-04T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/261634175,"Community of Fate, the memoirs of German Jews in Melbourne, captures for future generations what it was like being a migrant in the Australian Jewish community during World War II and immediately following, Professor Louis Waller said.",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article261634175?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1980-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1989-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The Australian Jewish News (Melbourne, Vic. : 1935 - 1999)",112.27488708496094,very relevant
266908481,WW2 ingenuity German Schwimmwagen,"  yiwiH'i.'Miiw   German  Schwimmwagen   DURING  WW2  and  the  period  leading  up  to  it  Germany  produced  many  deadly,  but  some  interest-   ing  weapons  and  vehi  cles.  Among  them  was  the  Schwimmwagen.  The  Schwimmwagen  ,  was  an  amphibious  cousin  of  the  Kuebelwagen,  pride  of  the  Wehr-  macht  and  ""Rommel's  Raiders"".  ;  The  Schwimmwagen  shared  the  mechanicals  of  the  Kuebel  wagen,  but  its  history  goes  back  to  1932  when  a  German  indus-  trialist,  Hans  Trippel,  unveiled  a  prototype  ,  amphibious;  car  with  four-wheel-drive  arid  .  a  four-  1  cylinder  engine.  Trippel's  amphibious  car  was  meant  to  be  used  for  sporting  interests  oply,  but  as  war  clouds  .gathered,  it  was  .quickly  con  verted  to  military  use.;.  Trippel  took  over  the  Ettore  Bugatti  plant  '  and  used  ;  the'  plant's  tools  to  produce  Opel  -\  powered  Trippels,  but  it  soon  became  obvious  to  the  German  :  High  Command  that  a  less  ex-  -  pensive  model  ,  was  needed.  :  -  The  next  step  was  to  order,  Dr  :  Ferdinand  Porsche  to  design  an  amphibious  version  around  the  same,  mechanicals.  ""  :  The  first  Schwimmwagen  was  called  the  Porsche  128.   After  a  prototype  series  of  150  Schwimmwagens  .  had  been  :  tested;  and  evaluated  .in  field  trials  in  1940,  a  second  genera  tion'  was  put  into  production,  consisting  of  a  Volkswagen  floor-  :  pari  attached  to  a  flat-bottom  of.  sheet  metal  capped  .  with  nose  and  tail  fairings.  ,  The  power  plant  was  a  .  1  ,134  cc  flat-four,  an  increase  in  .  size  over  the  Kuebels  ,  original  985  cc.;  ,  ;  Both  the  front  and  rear  ,  sus  pension  were  outside'  the  hull  -  and  required  rubber  boots  to  '  prevent  water  leakage.  :  The  original;  cars  were  slab-  sided,  but  doors  were  later  added.  The  unique  design  of  the  car  made  it  possible  to  drive  it  with  a  -  .  ,  front  or  rear  wheel  removed  —  a  characteristic  .  of  the  -Citroen  today.  J  Both  the  Kuebel  and  the  Schwimm  had  limited  slip  dif-  .  ferentials  to'  give  the  tyre  ,  with  the  most  grip  the  pulling  power""  when  stuck  in  riiud  or  snow.  :  The  biggest  difference  be  tween  the  Kuebel  arid'  the  Schwimm  was  that  the  latter'  had  four-wheel-drive,  something  it  needed  .  to  keep  it  going  in  the  muddy  marshland  it  had  to  negotiate.   Sirice  its  maximurn  speed  in  ,  the  water  was  only,  iO  kiWh,  the  .  Schwimm  was  difficult  to  beach  and  the  extra  two  wheels  helped  ;  get  it  ashore.  ,  The  propulsiori  unit  in  the  :  water  was  a  primitive  application  of  what  boatmakers  now,  adver-  .  tise  as  ""inboard/outboard"".  The  motor  was  inboard  but  the  propellor  was  outboard,  con-  >  sisting  of  a  three-bladed  prop  on  ;  .the  end'  of  a  jointed  arm'which,  when,  stored  vertically,  allowed  .  the  vehicle  to  drive  on  land.  .  ''  Unfortunately,  unlike  a  real  '  boat,  there  was  no  reverse  gear  and  no  rudder  :  —  the/16  x  6-inch  tyres  supposedly  serving  that  purpose.  .  Schwimmwagens  are  today  more  rare  than  Kuebelwagehs  because,  under  the  terms  of  the  ,  peace  treaty,  the  German  Navy;  had  to  cut  up  all  its  boats  for  .  scrap.  '.

126878688,'German-style' proliferation WINE,"  'German-style'  proliferation   By  BRENT  WHYTE*   If  imitation  is  the;sincerest  flattery,  then   German  vintners  must  feel  very  flattered  in  light  of  the  increasing  proliferation  of'German-style'   wines.   The  first  'German-style'  wines  were  produced  well  over  a  century  ago  by  German  emigrants  whose  vinicuitural  traditions  and  skills  were  transplanted  miles  away  from  the  Rhine  and  Mosel  valleys.   Even  today  wines  are  grown,  produced  and  bottled  in  places  where  large  numbers  of  Germans  immi  grated  —  such  as  North  and  South  America,  Aus  tralia,  South  Africa  —  which  are  generically  called  'Rhine'  or  'Mosel'  wines.  However,  these  new-world  wines  which  are  named,  bottled  and/or  labelled  to  resemble  German  wines  do  not  necessarily  have  any  relation  to  any  emigrant  heritage.   These  are  often  produced  by  large  corporations  which  have  implemented  the  recommendations  of  marketing  research  departments  to  produce  and  pack  age  an  imitation  of  a  quality  product  which  has  already  achieved  public  acceptance.  Advertising  and  promotional  campaigns  play  up  the  'German'  charac   ter  of  these  wines.   In  spite  of  their  old-world  appellations  these  'Ger  man-style'  wines  are  usually  found  only  in  the  new  world  countries  where  they  are  produced.   Another  breed  of  'German-style'  wine  has  recently  emerged  which  is  distributed  worldwide.  Para  doxically,  this  new  imitator  is  produced  right  at  home  in  Germany  ...  paying  compliment  to  German  ex  pertise,  in  vinicuitural  technology.  These  'German  style'  wines  are  made  from  grapies  or  blends  of  wines  from  different  EEC  countries  which  are  transported  into  Germany  to  be  made  into  wine  or  blended,  then  put  into  containers  (bottles,  casks  ,  or  tanks)  and   marketed.  Because  the  final  stage  of  production  takes  place  in  Germany,  these  wines  may  be  labelled  'Product  of  Germany'-—  even  though  the  wine  itself  is  not  necessarily  of  German  origin.   ,  Often  these  table  wines  from  different  countries  of  the  EEC  are  given  German-sounding  names  and  German-looking  bottles  and  labels.  Add  to  this  the  German  name  and  address  of  the  producer  or  bottler  or  shipper  —  which  must  appear  on  the  label  —  and  the  consumer  can  easily  mistake  one  of  these  'German  style'  wines  for  an  authentic  German  wine.   There  is  an  easy  way  to  identify  an  authentic  German  wine:  look  for  the  wine's  official  quality  control  number,  the  'A.P.Nr',  on  the  label.   A  German  wine  bearing  an  'A.P.Nr.'  offers  the  ""consumer  the  following  guarantee.   The  wine  is  100  per  cent  German  in  origin  and  the   name  of  a  designated  wine-growing  region  within  Germany  —  or  the  umbrella  geographical  designa  tion  ""Liebfraumilch""  —  must  appear  on  the  label.  And  the  wine  has  passed  a  three-stage  test,  beginning   with  Government  inspections  in  the  vineyards  at  harvest  time,  followed  by  a  laboratory  analysis  of  the  young  wine,  arid  ending  with  a  blind  sensory  test  conducted  by  professional  wine  tasters  at  Government  testing  stations.  The  final  two  digits  of  the  'A.P.Nr.'  indicate  the  year  in  which  the  wine  passed  the  test.   One  reason  that  more  'German-style'  wines  are  appearing  in  supermarkets  and  wine  shops  around  the  world,  often  displayed  in  the  midst  of  authentic  German  wines,  is  that  the  supply  of  German  wines  is  limited  by  natural  factors.   The  weather  greatly  influences  the  quantity  of  wine  able  to  be  produced  each  year.  At  present,  supply   vwine   is  tight  due  to  the  1980  and  1981  harvests  which,  when  combined,  equal  slightly  more  than  one  year's  average  production.   Furthermore,  the  vineyards  on  the  slopes  along  the  Rhine  and  Mosel  are  situated  between  riverbanks  and  forested  hillsides,  and  thus  cannot  be  expanded.  As  demand  for  German  wine  continues  to  increase  both  at  home  and  abroad  some  distributors  are  trying  to  meet  the  need  with  'German-style*  wines.   Even  the  best  imitation  cannot  substitute  for  the  real  thing.  Authentic  German  wine  has  a  character   and  tradition  of  its  own.   Certain  elements  which  contribute  to  the  unique  character  of  German  wine  can,  of  course,  be  suc  cessfully  ""relocated""  abroad:  grape  varieties,  techno  logical  improvements,  even  winemakers.  But  other  factors,  such  as  the  soil  and  climatic  conditions  where  German  wines  grow,  will  always  remain  indigenous  to  Germany.   This  is  why  a  German  Riesling  wine  has  a  bouquet  and  taste  which  is  distinct  from  that  of  an  American  or  Australian  Riesling  wine.  The  one  is  not  necessarily  better  or  worse  than  the  other,  they  are  by  nature   different.   And  so  it  is  with  German  wine  and  'German-style'  wine:  no  matter  how  much  alike  they  appear,  they  are  by  nature  different.   *Mr  Whyte  is  the  manager,  German  Wine   Information  Service,  North  Sydney.",1982-02-15T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/126878688,"IF imitation is the sincerest flattery, then German vintners must feel very flattered in light of the increasing proliferation of 'German-style' wines.",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126878688?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1980-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1989-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,The Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995),112.2186508178711,very relevant
261332086,GERMAN ARMS TO SAUDI?,"  GERMAN  ARMS  TO  SAUDI?   JERUSALEM,  (JTA):  Deputy  foreign  minister  Yehuda  Ben  Meir  warned  of  a  cloud  that  could  darken  Israeli-German  relations:  the  possibility  that  Bonn  might  sell  advanced  weaponry  to  Saudi  Arabia  or  other  Arab  countries.   Delivering  a  key-note  speech  on  the  opening  day  of  the  annual  meeting  of  the  Israel-Germany  Friendship  Associations,  Ben-Meir  said  Israel  could  not  agree  with  nor  acquiesce  in  such  a  prospect.   Israeli  sources  forecast  in  tensified  diplomatic  action  by  Jerusalem  in  the  weeks  ahead  designed  to  forestall  any  arms  sales.   Recently,  following  Chancellor  Helmut  Kohl’s   visit  to  Saudi  Arabia,  Ger  man  officials  sought  to  distinguish  between  offensive  weapons,  such  as  the  Leopard  Two  tank,  and  defensive  weapons  such  as  anti-tank  devices  and  anti  aircraft  systems.   But  Israel  has  declared  firmly  that  it  recognises  no  such  distinction.  Ben-Meir  in  his  address  today  dwelt  on  the  special  character  “  —  the  Bonn-Jerusalem  relation  ship”,  a  character  moulded  by  the  Holocaust  experience.   SUPPORT   Referring  to  the  Lebanon  situation,  Ben-Meir  urged  European  and  other  Western  States  to  exercise  their  in  fluence  and  persuasive  powers  over  Syria  to  moderate  Damascus’  hostili  ty  to  the  Lebanon-Israel  agreement  of  May  17.   The  Deputy  Minister  said  this  agreement  was  the  manifestation  of  “Lebanon’s  desire  for  sovereignty  and  in   dependence.  But  Syria  sought  to  impose  its  own  will”  on  Lebanon,  to  the  detriment  of  Lebanon’s  sovereignty,  Ben-Meir  said.   He*  predicted  that  a  new   PLO  that  would  arise  from  the  debacle  of  Tripoli  (where  Yasser  Arafat  was  still  being  pounded  by  the  Syrian  backed  rebels)  would  be  a  front  organisation  for  Syria.   Ben-Meir  expressed  the  hope  that  Palestinians  living   in  Judea  and  Samaria  would  recognise  the  vast  gap  —  “between  the  PLO  and  real  freedom  fighters”  and  would  in  consequence  of  this  realisation  turn  towards  direct  negotiations  with  us  within  the  framework  of  Camp  David.

The  Prince  is  said  to  have  renewed  his  Government’s  continued  interest  in  the  supply  of  the  most  modern  German  tank,  of  the  Leopard  II  type,  as  well  as  in  the  delivery  of  other  Ger  man  military  equipment.

263199146,German president accompanying Herzog,"  German  president  accompanying  Herzog   Bv  WLADIMIR  STRUMINSKI   BONN.  -  In  an  unprecedented,  step,  German  President  Richard  von  Veiszaecker  will  accom   pany  President  Herzog  throughout  his  visit  this  week,  von  Weiszaecker  told  reporters.   Herzog,  due  to  arrive  here  on  Monday,  will  visit  the  former  death  camp  Bergen-Belsen,  the  city  of  Worms,  and  West  Berlin.  The  German  president  offered  to  accompany  Herzog  because  of  the  great  importance  he  attaches  to  the  visit,  which  he  called  “an  extraordinary  event  in  the  relations  between  the  two  countries  and  the  two  peoples.”   Von  Weiszaecker  also  said  that  his  visit  to  Israel   in  1985  and  Herzog’s  visit  to  Germany  were  just   two  events  in  the  development  of  bilateral  rela  tions.  He  stressed  that  Herzog’s  visit  did  not  conclude  “a  chapter  of  history.”   Asked  about  his  defence  of  his  father  Ernst  von   Weiszaecker,  who  was  tried  for  war  crimes  by  the  Allies  after  World  War  II,  the  president  said  that  he  had  helped  his  father  “out  of  deep  conviction,”  adding  that  he  would  do  it  again.

261323922,Book Review Righteous German,"  Book  Review   Righteous  German   TERENCE  PR1TTIE   Schindler’s  Ark.  By  Thomas  Kepeally.  Hodder  &  Stoughton.   Thomas  Keneally’s  novel  brings  back  memories  to  hundreds  of  Jewish  Holocaust  survivors  of  the  man  who  became  the  greatest  figure  in  their   lives,  i   In  Jerusalem’s  Yad  Vashem  a  handful  of  the  elect  have  been  honoured  by  trees  planted  in  memory  of  “Righteous  Gentiles”  —  men  and  women  who  risked  their  lives  to  save  those  of  Jews  in  the  black  days  of  Nazi  persecution.  High  among  these  is  the  name  of  Oskar  Schindler,  a  Sudeten  Gentian  who  against  all  SS  pressure  insisted  on  employing  Jews  in  his  war  time  factories  near  Cracow  in  Poland,  Jews  who  were  never  beaten  or  killed  and  whom  he  treated  with  respect  and  even  affection  —  those  with  whom  he  had  most  contact  were  referred  to  as  “Schindler’s  Children”  and  many  of  them  remained  in  close  contact  with  him  up  to  the  time  of  his  death,  in  October  1974.  At  a  rough  estimate  he  helped  to  save  the  lives  of  about  1200  Jews.   This  he  did  not  only  by  treating  them  well  and  feeding  them  in  a  way  which  would  have  been  deemed  lucullan  by  the  inmates  of  concentration-camps,  but  by  using  his  personal  good  relations  with  the  SS  to  prevent  their  deportation  to  such  places  of  horror.  When  some  of  the  women  from  his  Brinnlitz  factory  were  removed  to  Auschwitz,  he  followed  them  there  and  argued  stoutly  and  stubbornly  for  their  return  to  his  care.  His  case  was  that  they  were  all  skilled  workers  —  his  factories  produced  mainly  enamel  ware  but  munitions  too  —  and  that  their  departure  had  disrupted  production.  Keneally  tells  the  almost  unbelievable  story  how  Schindler  won  his  case,  and  how  the  SS  authorities  at  Auschwitz,  even  while  busy  with  their  extermination,  returned  all  “his  Jews”  to  him,  and  to  safety.   This  was  a  typical  instance  of  Oskar  Schindler’s  “chutzpa.”  He  was  no  intellectual.  He  was,  intriguingly,  a  man  of  few  principles;  he  drank  a  great  deal,  he  was  habitually  unfaithful  to  his  wife  and  unashamedly  promiscuous,  he  had  not  the  slightest  hesitation  in  using  the  black  market  and  bribing  whenever  expedient  —  to  gain  the  concession  of  safeguarding  ‘‘his  Jews”  from  the  SS,  he  used  an  interesting  admixture  of  .diamonds,  alcohol  and  ham.  But  he  had  what  the  Nazis  would  have  considered  a  shocking  “weakness”  —  for  Jews.  By  presenting  the  story  as  a  novel,  Keneally  tries  to  show  how  something  ,deep  within  Schindler,  some  unexplained  instinct,  prompted  his  determination  to  succour  and  defend  the  Jews  in  his  care.   He  met  no  heroic  end,  dying  of  hardening  of  the  arteries  which  may  well  have  been  brought  on  by  his  drinking  habits.  He  was  none  the  less  a  “Righteous  Gentile”  for  all  that  —  if  only  because,  with  the  end  of  the  war  in  sight,  he  made  a  birthday-speech  in  front  of  members  of  the  dreaded  SS,   promising  that  he  would  stick  the  war  \   out  until  “his  Jews”  were  safe  and  i  free.  He  was  37,  and  risking  the  whole   second  half  of  his  life.  His  life,  both  l  before  and  after  the  war,  was  that  of  a   drinker  and  businessman  and  totally  /  j   unmemorable  and  after  the  war  he  had  i  to  be  helped  repeatedly  by  survivors   among  “his  Jews.”  Yet  he  was  one  of  j   that  small  band  of  Germans  who  ?  needed  a  recognisable  challenge  to  his  true  morality,  and  who  rose  to  the  occasion.   Keneally’s  novel  has  just  won  the  !  Booker  Prize,  Britain’s  premier  i  literary  award,  and  deservedly  so.  After  talking  to  many  surviving   “Schindler  Jews”  about  their  ]  memories,  he  has  presented  his  story  j  as  “faction”  —  a  detailed,   documented  true  story  presented  and  .  *  built  up  as  fiction  —  but  he  draws  a  *  convincing  picture  which  lingers  in  the  1  mind  of  the  total  Jewish  nightmare  of  1  the  Holocaust  and  of  one  ordinary  |   German’s  stand  against  it.",1982-11-19T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/261323922,Thomas Keneally’s novel brings back memories to hundreds of Jewish Holocaust survivors of the man who became the greatest figure in their,https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article261323922?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1980-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1989-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The Australian Jewish News (Melbourne, Vic. : 1935 - 1999)",112.2101821899414,very relevant

120855491,Manila wants German industry,"  Manila  wants   German   industry   WEST  German  industries  and  com   mercial  concerns  are  being  actively  encouraged  to  use  the  Philippines  as  a  base  for  computer  software  development  activities.   The  call  came  from  Dr  Victor  Sandoval,  president  of  Nixdorf  Computer  Philippines  Inc.,  during  an  ad  dress  in  Bonn  to  members  of  West  Germany's  presti  gious  Deutsche'  Industrie  und  Handelskammer  (DIHT)  —  the  West  German  Chamber  of  Commerce.   Dr  Sandoval  was  a  member  of  a  high-powered  Fili  pino  investment  promotion  group,  headed  by  Philip  pines  president  Corazon  Aquino,  which  recently  toured  West  Germany,  France  and  Belgium.   Dr  Sandoval  told  DIHT  members  that  with  1992  approaching,  Europeans  will  have  to  think  of  the  'glob  alisation  of  end-user  markets  as  well  as  production   resources.'   A  single,  unique  characteristic  of  computer  software  —  the  fact  that  it  is  perfectly  transportable  and  can  be  shipped  over  telephone  lines  at  extremely  high  speeds  —  made  this  globalisation  unavoidable.   ""The  location  of  the  end-user  market  relative  to  the  location  of  the  production  plant  becomes  immaterial,""  said  Dr  Sandoval.   ""The  software  producer  can  thus  set  up  a  plant  where  production  facilities  and  input  resources  are  optimal,  and  still  be  in  a  position  to  market  the  pro   duct  world-wide.   ""In  the  information  technology  field,  generally,  hardware  costs  are  decreasing  and  software  costs  are  climbing;  Germany  is  no  exception,""  Dr  Sandoval   said.   In  Germany,  the  services  of  software  professionals  are  not  only  expensive,  they  are  difficult  to  recruit.   Viewed  from  this  standpoint,  according  to  Dr  San  doval,  the  Philippines  is  one  of  the  most  attractive  countries  in  the  world  for  software  production,  for  a  variety  of  reasons:   •  The  Philippines  offers  a  large  pool  of  easily  trainable  staff;  from  a  population  of  60  million,  a  company  can  be  very  selective  in  recruitment.   •  Englishes  universally  spoken.   •  Salaries  in  the  computer  sector  are  at  about  80  per  cent  of  corresponding  salary  levels  in  Germany.   •  In  general,  operating  costs  in  the  Philippines  are  lower  than  in  other  countries  around  the  region.   •  The  Philippines  boasts  an  adequate  network  of  data-quality  transmission  links  to  all  major  centres  of   the  world.   Dr  Sandoval  said  that  typically,  software  activities  in  the  Philippines  covera  wide  spectrum,  including  the  coding  of  program  routines,  the  testing  of  programs,  the  development  of  application  software  packages,  and  the  conversion  of.programs  to  suit  new  conditions.   He  said  that  while  American  companies  were  strongly  represented  in  the  field,  Nixdorf  itself  had  also  recognised  the  potential  with  the  establishment  of  the   NixdorfComputer  Software  Centre  in  the  Philippines.'  :  ,   I  Nixdorfnow  maintains  a  full  research  and  developer  .j,t  I  ment  team  in  Manila  —  right  at  the  centre  of  the   Asia-Pacific  region.

After  raising  expectations  amongst  the  survivors  after  East  and  West  Germany  came  together  in  1993  by  inviting  them  to  apply  for  restitu  tion,  the  German  government  has  now  severely  limited  the  number  of  eligible  restitution  recipients.   It  is  as  much  the  way  the  German  gov  ernment  has  gone  about  definining  some   of  the  eligibility  criteria  for  compensation,  as  it  is  the  unwillingness  to  meet  all  or  most  of  the  claims,  which  has  so  trauma  tised  and  angered  the  Holocaust  survivors  and  outraged  international  Jewish  organi  sations.

In  the  face  of  numerous  campaigns  to  buy  Australian  made,  you  not  only  choose  to  export  our  money,  you  choose  to  direct  those  dollars   towards  the  Mark.   The  current  position  of  Count  Otto  Lambsdorff,  Spokesman  for  German  Industry,   is  that  he  has  offered  a  sum  to  the  one  million   living  survivors  that  boils  down  to  US  $5263  for  forced  labourers  and  US  $1547  for  slave  labourers.

261593291,German crimes trial,"  German  crimes  trial   ACCUSED  Nazi  war  criminal  Jo-t  sef  Schwammberger  was  indicted  last  month  in  court  at  Stuttgart,   West  Germany,  on  charges  of,  murdering  “at  least  50  Jews”  dur  ing  World  War  II.  He  also  was  charged  as  an  accessory  to  the  murder  of  at  least  3,377  other  peo  ple,  according  to  the  World  Jew  ish  Congress,  which  learned  of  the  indictment  from  the  Jewish  com  munity  of  West  Berlin.  Schwamm  berger  admitted  to  ordering  the  execution  of  one  person  under  “special  circumstances,”  but  other  than  that,  “he  has  completely  de  nied  his  crimes,”  according  to  Hel  mut  Kronbacher,  spokesman  for  the  prosecutor’s  office.   Schwammberger,  78,  who  is  be  ing  held  at  the  Stammheim  maxi  mum  security  prison,  was  extradited  from  Argentina  in  May,  after  a  long  proceeding  that  in  cluded  his  hospitalisation  in  an  Ar  gentine  hospital  for  a  mysterious  coma.  The  Stuttgart  court  found  him  fit  to  stand  trial.  The  prosecutor’s  office  said  the  trial  would  probably  begin  early  next  year.  That  would  likely  make  Schwammberger  the  first  alleged  Nazi  war  criminal  to  be  tried  in  a  unified  Germany.  A  guilty  verdict  would  bring  a  life  sentence.   A  former  lieutenant  in  the  Waf  fen  SS  and  commandant  of  several  concentration  camps  in  Poland,  Schwammberger  allegedly  was  known  for  his  particularly  cruel  killings  of  Jews.  He  has  been  ac  cused  by  survivors  of  camps  of  Jewish  areas  in  the  Polish  towns  of  Przemysl,  Mielec,  Rozwadow  and  Stalowa-Wola  of  smashing   children’s  heads  against  walls,  throwing  people  alive  into  fires  and  shooting  people  point-blank.  Witnesses  said  they  saw  Schwammberger  use  pliers  to  re  move  gold  teeth  from  prisoners.  He  was  known  as  the  “butcher  of  Rozwadow.”   After  the  war,  Schwammberger  was  arrested  in  Austria  with  bags  of  jewellery  stolen  from  Jews,  which  he  admitted  under  question  ing.  He  escaped,  probably  in  1948,  to  Argentina  with  what  is  believed  to  have  been  help  from  Odessa,  a  Nazi  fugitive  network.  Before  escaping  detention  in  1945,  Schwammberger,  an  Austrian  by  birth,  admitted  having  shot  about  35  Jews,  according  to  the  Austrian  police.  The  Austrian  police  files  were  obtained  by  the  Anti  Defamation  League  of  B’nai   B’rith.   The  indictment  in  Stuttgart  stems  from  a  warrant  for  Schwammberger’s  arrest  that  West  Germany  issued  in  1972.  Addi  tional  charges  against  him  were  made  in  recent  years.  The  Wiesen  thal  Centre  expects  to  play  a  strong  role  at  the  trial,  having  represen  tatives  present  and  bringing  new  witnesses  to  testify,  “including  some  whom  we  recently  found  and  others  who  were  frightened  of  go  ing  on  their  own,”  Rabbi  Marvin  Hier  of  the  Los  Angeles-based  Simon  Wiesenthal  Centre  said.   “At  this  trial,  there  will  be  more  witnesses  to  testify  against  Josef  Schwammberger  than  there  was  at  any  Nazi  war  criminal  trial  of  re  cent  memory,  including  Adolf  Eichmann,”  he  said.

261743476,German Jews growth,"  German  Jews  growth   Bonn:  ACTIVISTS  in  the  Jewish  community  of  Germany  say  it  is  possible  there  are  more  than  40,000  Jews  living  in'  Germany,  some  5,000  in  excess  of  the  offi  cial  tally,  and  that  the  community  is  well  on  its  way  to  increasing  its  membership  to  50,000.  The  acti  vists  feel  that  perhaps  some  5,000  Jews  in  Germany  go  uncounted  be  cause  of  failure  to  register  as  such.   The  German  government  col  lects  taxes  for  recognised  religious  communities.  The  authorities  transfer  to  the  churches  10  percent  of  the  income  tax  revenues  col  lected  from  the  churches’  mem  bers.  Individuals  who  fail  to  register  as  members  of  a  religious  community  save  10  percent  on  their  income  taxes.   “Actually,  we  have  very  few  cases  of  people  who  go  to  the  au  thorities  and  tell  them  that  they  are  withdrawing,”  a  Jewish  commun  ity  official  said.  “But  we  know  of  many  Jewish  newcomers  who  sim   ply  do  not  register  as  Jews  when  they  settle  in  the  country.

127277985,Australian-German links,"  Australian-German  links   MADE  IN  AUSTRALIA.  Australian  Poet-   ry  Today.  Gegenwartsdichtung  Austral-   ians.  The  OZIit  Collection  Vol  3.  Bilin-  gual.  Edited  by  Cisela  Triesch  and  Rudi  Krausmann.  Cangan  Books  Australia.  317pp.  $29.95.   Reviewer:  RALPH  ELLIOTT.   Geoff  PAGE's  recent  A  Read-   er's  Guide  to  Contemporary  Australian  Poetry  discusses  the  work  of  100  contemporary  poets,   neatly  arranged  alphabetically  from  Robert  Adamson  to  Fay  Zwicky.  For  good  measure,  the  book  concludes  with  a  list  of  100  other  poets  sug-  gested  as  no  less  worthy  of  the  read-  er's  attention,  and  I  can  think  of  other  poets  who  deserve  a  place  in  either  list,  like  Canberra's  Michael  Thwaites  and  Geoff  Page  himself,  who  modestly  excluded  himself,  but  who  does  Figure  in  Made  In  Austra-   lia.   That  Gisela  Triesch's  and  Rudi  Krausmann's  bilingual  anthology  is  restricted  to  a  mere  80  poets  is  due  to  each  poem  being  faced  by  a  trans-  lation  into  German.  Forty-six  of  these  poets  also  figure  in  Page's  Guide,  and  there  is  more  than  coinci-  dental,  at  times  verbal,  similarity  be-  tween  Page's  lengthy  introduction  to  contemporary  Australian  poetry  and  Volker  Wolfs  German  introduction  to  the  bilingual  anthology.  Who  is  echoing  whom  is  not  for  me  to  spec-   ulate.   Wolf  is  one  of  the  group  of  transla-  tors  which  also  includes  the  two  edi-  tors,  charged  with  the  gargantuan  task  of  rendering  into  German  verse  the  enormous  variety  of  language  and  styles  represented  in  poems  as  diverse  as  Les  Murray's  ""The  people  are  eating  dinner  in  that  country  north  of  Legge's  Lake""  and  Ania  Walwicz's  performance  poems  (i.e.  poetic  prose  pieces)  ""Australia""  and   ""The  Tattoo"".   Inevitably,  the  translations  vary  considerably.  Where  Australian  poets  use  rhyme,  like  Rosemary  Dobson,  Chris  Wallace-Crabbe,  and  Eva  John-  son,  this  is  ignored  by  the  transla-  tors,  and  the  distinctive  cadences  of   individual  poems  are  often  lost,  espe-  cially  where  short  English  words  are  rendered  by  lengthy  German  nouns  or  verbs,  an  extreme  example  being  Bruce  Dawe's  ""like  a  traffic-report  helicopter  over  the  bankup""  which  becomes  the  monstrous  ""wie  ein  Ver-  kehrsueberwachungshubschrauber  ueber  dem  Stau"".  Jack  Davis's  rhyth-  mic,  melodic  ""We  welcome  the  sun  down  that  heralds  the  dark""  explodes  into  the  prosy  ""Wir  begruessen  den  Sonnenuntergang,  der  die  Dunkelheit  ankuendigt"".   Occasionally  one  wonders  whether  the  translators  really  caught  the  po-  et's  meaning.  In  Geoff  Page's  ""Small  town  Memorials""  the  final  four  lines  appear  to  me  to  refer  to  the  two  world  wars  in  reverse  order:  ""The  next  bequeathed  us/Parks  and  pools/But  something  in  that  first/De-  manded  stone.""  The  translation  turns  both  ""next""  and  ""first""  into  plural  nouns,  which  does  not  make  much  sense.  In  Judith  Beveridge's  ""In  the  Park""  the  line  ""of  the  moon  adrift""  becomes  ""des  Mondes,  der  fei"",  which  I  assume  is  a  misprint  for  ""frei"".  And  are  Laurie  Duggan's  ""Qantas  Bags""  really  ""Tueten""  in  German,  a  word  which  connotes  ice  cream  cones  and  even  breathalyzers  rather  than  cabbin  baggage?   Admittedly,  these  are  trifling  cav-  ils  in  a  book  well  furnished  with  good  German  translations,  and  they   are  unlikely  to  detract  from  the  en-  joyment  which  Austrian  or  German  or  Swiss  readers  will  derive  from  the  poems  in  this  excellent  anthology.  Moreover,  considering  the  steady  in-  flux  of  English  words  into  contempo-  rary  German,  of  which  visitors  to  German-speaking  countries  or  view-  ers  of  Derrick  must  be  very  con-  scious,  it  seems  quite  proper  that  Jennifer  Strauss's  ""sand  and  sex""  should  appear  as  ""Sand  und  Sex""  or  that  Robert  Harris's  ""junkies""  should  appear  as  ""die  Junkies""  in  Rudi  Krausmann's  translation.  Even  the  retention  of  ""possum""  in  the  German  text  of  some  poems  seems  appropri-  ate,  although  in  another  poem  the  word  is  rendered  by  the  German   word  ""Beutelratten"".   Most  of  the  translations  do  justice  to  the  original  Australian  poems.  In  a  few  instances  they  seem  almost  an  improvement  on  the  originals,  which  is  not  unknown  in  the  history  of  po-  etic  translations.  Nancy  Cato's  ""The  Dead  Swagman""  reads  very  well  in  the  German  version,  where  the  pen  ultimate  line  ""die  Wurzeln  und  Kno-  chen  beruehren  sich  auf  dem  Boden""  suggests  an  even  closer  intimacy  of  the  dead  man  and  the  tree  than  the  original.  Other  renderings  which  have  struck  me  as  particularly  felici-  tous  are  Krausmann's  translations  of  Kate  Llewellyn's  ""Finished""  and  the  German  version  by  Krausmann  and  Gerald  Ganglbauer  of  Richard  Tip-  ping's  ""Mangoes"".  The  German  writ-  er  Hans  Magnus  Enzensberger  trans-  lated  (except  for  one  stanza)  the  longest  poem  in  the  book,  John  Tran-  ter's  ""The  False  Atlas"";  it  is  a  re-  markably  close  yet  wholly  idiomatic  German  rendering.   As  Gisela  Triesch  points  out  in  her  postscript,  almost  half  the  poets  here  represented  are  women,  and   there  is  a  fair  selection  of  Aboriginal  and  ethnic  writers.  They  all  rightly  belong  in  an  anthology  of  ""Austra-  lian  Poetry  Today"",  and  the  themes  which  many  of  their  poems  address,  like  Eva  Johnson's  ""Right  To  Be"",  Hyllus  Maris's  ""Spiritual  Song  of  the  Aborigine"",  or  Marita  Kefala's  ""They  Are  Still  Coming"",  continue  to  be  highly  topical  in  Australia  today.   The  arrangement  of  the  poets  in  Made  in  Australia  is  by  date  of  birth,  beginning  with  Margaret  ""Diesendorf,  who  was  born  in  1912  and  died  two  years  ago,  and  leading  up  to  poets  born  in  1960.  Obviously,  editorial  preference  and  available  space  deter-  mined  inclusions  and  omissions,  but  few  readers  will  dispute  that  it  is  a  well-balanced,  carefully  selected  an-  thology.  The  inclusion,  as  the  last  poem,  of  Maureen  Watson's  ""Step-  ping  Out""  with  its  final  ""I  don't  walk,  I  strut,/""Cause  now,  I'm  liber-  ated""  provides  a  very  moving  end-  ing.  There  are  no  dates  alongside  her   name.   The  only  thing  I  miss  in  this  otherwise  highly  commendable  book  are  brief  biographical  notes,  such  as  Geoff  Page  provides  in  his  Guide.  Australian  readers  can  turn  to  the  recent  second  edition  of  The  Oxford  Companion  to  Australian  Literature,  but  others?  However,  it  is  the  poems  themselves  that  matter,  and  there  is  God's  Plenty  in  Made  in  Australia,  a  book  of  which  lovers  of  poetry  may  well  feel  proud.

261621720,feature German antisemitism,"  ^feciture/   German  antisemitism   Colin  Tatz   1  THOUGHT  we  were  finally  done  with   the  “Hitler-arrived-h  om-outer-space-in  1933”  explanation  of  German  anti  semitism.  Yet  Professor  Bill  Rubinstein,  reviewing  Daniel  Goldhagen’s  Hitler’s  Will  ing  Executioners  (AJN  31/5/96),  revisits  this  mischief.  Perhaps  not  mischief  —  rather,  some  appallingly  bad  history.   It  is  “simply  wrong"",  he  declares,  to  say  “that  Germany  was  pervasively  antisemitic  before  Hitler  came  to  power”.  There  was  a  “golden  age  of  Jewish  achievement”,  typi  fied  by  Berlin  giving  Einstein  “a  princely  official  residence”  in  1930.  Jews,  he  con  tends,  were  “universally  accepted  in  Weimar  Germany”;  most  had  good,  “even  excellent  relations  with  their  Gentile  neigh  bours  until  1938”  —  in  fact,  he  writes,  most  didn’t  perceive  Germany  as  “murderously  anti-Jewish  even  after  1933”  and  “most  Ger  mans  remained  where  they  were  until  after  Kristallnacht”.   In  so  saying,  Rubinstein  deplores  the  “ahistoricity  which  bedevils  so  many  works   on  the  Holocaust"".   My  concern  is  with  his  unhistoriCity.  What  can  and  should  be  said  about  the  position  of  German  Jews  from  the  end  of  the  19th  century  until  1933  in  the  cultural,  political,  academic,  scientific,  social  and  even  sporting  fields?   Modern  German  antisemitism  began  with  the  peasant  riots  of  1819.  And  while  there  are  different  antisemitisms,  much  of  the  content  forms  a  continuity.  From  the  mid  dle  of  the  last  century,  the  Jew  was  depict  ed  in  literature  as  being  without  soul,  with  out  the  traditional  humble  German  virtues,  uprooted,  troublesome,  malevolent,  shift  less.  Much  of  the  literature  followed  Gus  tav  Freytag’s  character  Veitel  Itzig,  who  was  ugly,  grasping,  without  a  shred  of  humani  ty.  Hermann  Godsche’s  novels  revealed  the  Jews  as  conspirators  against  the  Gentile   world.   Wilhelm  Marr,  who  coined  the  word  “Antisemitism”  and  founded  the  Antisemite  League  in  1879,  placed  much  store  in  these  literary  pieces.  His  “Semitism”  was  invent  ed  to  distinguish  between  German  and  Jew,  not  between  Christian  and  Jew.  Through  his  works  and  those  of  Eugen  Duhring  and  Heinrich  von  Treitschke,  the  stereotype  of  the  dangerous  Jew  was  integrated  into  the  dynamics  of  the  Volkisch  struggle  against  a  state  that  didn’t  represent,  for  them,  the  true  will  of  the  German  Volk.   As  early  as  1895,  Hermann  Ahlwardt  introduced  a  Reichstag  Bill  to  close  Ger  many’s  borders  to  “Israelites  who  are  not  citizens  of  the  Reich”.  Teutons  wanted  no  more  Jews,  people  of  a  different  race  and  culture,  people  who  would,  as  cholera  bacil  li,  cause  the  death  of  Germans.  Mixing  the  metaphor,  he  saw  them  as  beasts  of  prey  who  had  best  be  exterminated.  But  tramps,  beggars  and  social  nuisances  were  differ  ent:  they  were  “Germans  like  us""  —  some  thing  the  Jew  could  never  be.  The  Bill  was  defeated  by  167  to  51  in  favour  —  but  suc  ceeded  in  1906.   The  German  rather  than  the  Nazi  state  had  a  view  of  the  Jews  as  a  biologically  determined  race.  Frenchman  Comte  Arthur  de  Gobineau’s  works  on  “the  essential  inequality  of  the  human  races”  postulated  that  mixed  and  mongrel  man  had  finally  come  together  in  a  “pure  blood  type”  and  that  Jews,  as  “baneful  germ  plasms”,  were  the  omnipresent  danger  to  that  purity.  De  Gobineau  societies  spread  throughout  Ger  many,  aided  by  Wagner  and  his  son-in-law,  Houston  Stewart  Chamberlain.  They  spear  headed  an  antisemitism  which,  while  not  yet  physically  murderous,  was  homicidal  in  language,  spirit  and  intent.  From  then  on,  journals  and  university  departments  of  “racial  hygiene”  flourished  —  well  before  Hitler.  Volkisch  belief,  now  substantiated  by  “science”,  owed  nothing  to  Hitler,  but  much  to  Imperial  and  Weimar  Germany.   Legally,  Jews  received  little  justice  and  almost  no  satisfaction  from  the  Weimar  courts.  The  Centralverein  fur  deutsche  Staatsburger  judischen  Glaubens,  founded  in  1893,  spent  decades  fighting  attacks,  calum  nies  and  libels  on  Jews,  using  Paragraph  130  of  the  Criminal  Code  (on  incitement  to  racial  violence)  and  then,  in  despair  at  the  courts  finding  any  favour  for  Jews,  using  Paragraph  166  on  crimes  against  religion.   The  chief  defamer  was,  of  course,  Julius  Streicher  and  his  Der  Sturmer.  In  the  “Great   24   Nuremberg  Ritual  Murder  Trial”  of  1929,  Streicher  was  charged  with  suggesting  that  some  unsolved  deaths  were  Jewish  ritual  murders.  He  was  given  two  months  in  prison,  but  nearly  every  other  case  brought  against  him  resulted  in  acquittal  because  he  argued,  successfully,  that  he  was  never  attacking  the  Jewish  religion,  but  the  sepa   rate  Jewish  race!   In  1924  a  judge  came  to  the  aid  of  a  news  paper  editor  charged  with  incitement  against  Jews.  This  was  “far  from  incite  ment”,  he  ruled:  “even  the  best  men  of  our   An  illustration  from  one  ot  Julius  Streicher’s  antisemitic  children’s  books  depicts  blond  German  children  rejoicing  as  grossly  caricatured  Jewish  chddren  are  expelled  from  school.  Sbartav  oflhe  Dictators,  Time  Life  Books   nation  share  this  view”  (of  Jews).  A  Berlin  court  rejected  a  Jewish  landlord’s  claim  of  defamation  against  an  evicted  foreign  ten  ant  who  called  him  “a  German  swine”.  The  startling  judgment  was  that  “despite  his  German  citizenship,  the  plaintiff  does  not  fall  into  the  category  of  persons  popularly  connoted  by  the  word  ‘German’.”  Und  so  weiter'm  the  pre-Hitlerian  courts.   The  German  Youth  Movement,  the  Wan  denogel,  was  based  on  the  concept  of  Volk  —  that  is,  German  faith,  heroism,  tradition,  lore  and  all  the  Nordic  virtues.  By  1914,  92  percentre  of  the  local  chapters  reported  they  had  no  Jewish  members;  in  fact,  84  percent  had  specific  constitutional  clauses  banning  Jews.  Blau  Weiss,  the  Blue  and  White  Jewish  Youth  Movement,  was  found  ed  in  1916  in  self-recognition  of  Jews  as  sep   arate  from  the  mainstream.   How  comfortable  could  Jews  be  in  such  environments?  German  students  were  swept  up  by  Volkisch  ideology,  their  frater  nities  embracing  virulent  hostility  to  all  things  Jewish.  The  Jews  were  “the  enemy  within”  —  something  they  expressed  vio  lently.   Die  Mitteilungsblatter,  the  major  Jewish  journal  devoted  to  combatting  anti  semitism,  had  much  to  report.  Thus,  when  a  distinguished  legal  professor  told  his  class  to  read  the  works  of  two  Jewish  legal  theorists,  he  was  jeered  and  decried.  In  1920  Berlin  University  students  threatened  to  riot  if  the  university  went  ahead  with  a  memorial  service  for  the  assassinated  For  eign  Minister,  the  Jewish  Walter  Rathenau.   As  ever,  the  only  protection  for  Jews  was  to  form  their  own  fraternities,  starting  as  early  as  1896.  As  ever,  they  were  ostracised   by  university  authorities  and  closed  (down  at  every  opportunity.  Heidelberg  University  decreed  that  “the  very  existence  of  a  Jew  ish  fraternity  is  sufficient  to  endanger  peace  amongst  the  students”.   The  highest  form  of  social  interaction   among  students  was  duelling,  for  sport  and  for  honour.  Early  on,  Ger  man  students  barred  Jews  from  this  signifi  cant  activity.  Smash  the  Jewish  conspiracy  and  the  Volk  will  flourish  —  that  was  the  message  from  noisy  students  and  very  silent,  very  acquiescent  professors.   Jews  were  excluded  from  the  socially  important  gymnastic  organisations.  As  always,  they  had  to  form  their  own  Tumer  schaften.  Gershom  Scholem  has  written  poignantly  about  the  assimilating,  German  loving,  German-craving  Jews.  The  German  liberals  asked:  what  kind  of  civilisation  or  religion  or  culture  or  “race”  is  this  that  sur  renders  itself  in  this  way?  And  the  Jew  haters  asked:  what  kind  of  fifth  column,  what  kind  of  bacillus,  is  this  that  invades  us,  that  purports  to  be  “us”  when  it  so  patently  isn’t,  and  can’t  be?  Crushed  by  this  dilemma,  German  Jewish  male  youth  resort  ed  to  suicide  in  cosmic  numbers  between  the  wars.  Suicide  a  litmus  of  “excellent  rela  tions”  within  Germany?   Einstein,  his  “princely  official  residence""  notwithstanding,  was  hated  by  many.  As  one  Nobel  Laureate  observed:  “A  Jew  con  spicuously  lacks  understanding  for  the  truth,  in  contrast  to  the  Aryan  research  sci   entist.”   Rubinstein’s  “golden  age”  of  achievement  really  began  with  the  creation,  in  Septem  ber  1933,  of  the  first  (and  only)  Jewish  roof  body,  the  Reichsuertretung  der  Deutschen  Juden,  under  Rabbi  Leo  Baeck.  Under  the  direction  of  Martin  Buber,  Jewish  adult  edu  cation  programs  led  to  Schocken  Books  publishing  5000  tiles  between  1933  and  1938.  A  great  achievement  —  but  how  “golden""  were  the  dynamics  that  gave  rise   to  it?   So  what  did  the  majority  of  German  Jews  perceive  about  their  world?  How  comfort   able  were  they  in  a  society  in  which  they  believed  they  were  integrated  and  accept  ed,  in  which  they  pursued  German-ness  rather  than  Jewishness,  but  which  degrad   ed  them  in  special  laws,  denied  them  judi  cial  fairness,  excluded  them  from  the  social  and  sporting  life  of  universities,  despised  them  in  mainstream  literature,  excoriated  them  as  racially  different  —  and  danger   ous?   What  they  did,  Professor  Rubinstein,  was  leave,  in  great  numbers.  To  the  best  of  any  one’s  knowledge,  there  were  566,602  Jews  in  Germany  in  1933  —1  a  mere  0.86  percent  of  the  population.  By  1941,  347,103,  or  60  percent,,  had  left.  More,  significant  is  that  252,400,  or  just  on  45  percent,  had  left   before  Kristallnacht,  and  before  the  forced  emigration  policy  got  fully  under  way.   The  years  tell  their  own  story:  63,400  left  in  1933,  mainly  due  to  the  “de-Judaising""  of  the  public  service;  45,000  emigrated  in  1934  because  of  panic,  uncertainly,  alarm  at  the  desecration  of  shules  and  the  increase  in  arbitrary  arrests.  Enough  Jews  thought  1935  “a  good  year”  —  the  year  the  Nurem  berg  Laws  made  them  non-citizens;  the  feel  ing  was  that  they  could  accommodate  to  this  if  this  was  the  worst  that  was  to  be.  “Let’s  wait  another  winter,”  they  ratio  nalised,  even  though  the  optimists  knew  there  could  be  no  return  to  early  Weimar.  Only  35,000  left.  The  following  year  was  also  a  “good”  one,  the  Olympic  year,  when  34,000  emigrated.  1937  was  the  best  year  yet;  there  appeared  to  be  an  “accommoda  tion”  of  sorts  and  the  number  of  Jews  in  concentration  camps  was  low  —  only  7000!  The  following  year,  in  the  10  months  before  November  9,49,000  Jews  left.   Hitler  didn  t  arrive  with  an  X-File  package  called  antisemitism.  There  were  two  (or  more)  antisemitisms  in  Germany  and  it  cer  tainly  was  Hitler  who  radicalised  the  tradi  tional  form  of  it.  Rubinstein  asserts  that  Jews  were  comfortable  with  the  Weimar  brand  and  “enjoyed  excellent  relations”  with  their  despisers  and  detractors.  If  that  is  true,  then  it  tells  us  something  about  some  German  Jews  and  their  perceptions,  or  absence  of  them.  To  say  that  they  were  happy  is  not  to  say  that  there  was  no  objectively  visible  and  provable  danger  intrinsic  to  their  past  and  their  present.

261617318,German leader reassures,"  German  leader  reassures   Staff  writer   THE  STRENGTH  of  today’s  German  democracy  was  the  best  defence  against  any  threat  of  neo-Nazism,  Germany’s  President  Richard  von  Weizsaecker  told  a  delegation  of  Australian  Jewish  leaders  last  week  in  Melbourne   Unlike  the  ’30s,  when  the  Weimar  Republic’s  democracy  did  not  go  very  deep,  President  von  Weizsaeck  er  said  he  took  comfort  from  the  “liberal,  open-minded  and  tolerant”  reaction  by  the  German  people  to  recent  outbursts  of  violence  against  immigrants  and  guest-workers.   The  many  Germans  who  protest  ed  against  the  eruption  of  violence  as  soon  as  it  had  occurred  had  not   waited  for  their  political  leaders  to  l  act  but  had  taken  their  own  initia   \  tive,  the  German  president  said.   At  the  same  time  the  government  was  doing  its  utmost  to  oppose  the  racist  violence,  he  claimed,  citing  the  decision  by  the  Interior  Ministry  last  week  to  file  suit  against  the  extreme-right  wing  FRP  party  and  declare  it  unconstitutional.   President  von  Weizsaecker  was  speaking  last  Friday  afternoon  at  the  Grand  Hyatt  Hotel  during  his  first  official  engagement  after  arriving  in  Australia  as  the  guest  of  the  govern  ment  and  Governor-General  Bill  Hay  den.  He  was  responding  to  an  address  of  welcome  from  Executive   Council  of  Australian  Jewry  presi  dent  Isi  Leibler  who  spoke  on  behalf  of  11  invited  representatives  of  Jew  ish  communal  organisations.   “This  is  a  very  good  first  appoint  ment  in  Australia  under  your  aus  pices,”  the  German  head  of  state  told  the  Jewish  leaders.  He  was  accompanied  by  Germany’s  Minister  of  State  (Foreign  Affairs  Ministry)   Ursula  Seiler-Albring,  other  officials  from  the  Foreign  Ministry  and  the  office  of  the  federal  president,  and  the  German  Consul-General  in  Mel  bourne  Hans-Georg  Fein.   During  his  response  to  Mr  Leibler,  who  had  expressed  grave  disquiet  over  the  resurgence  of  neo-Nazism  in  Germany,  President  von  Weizsaecker  said  that  nothing  justi  fied  even  a  single  act  of  violence,  the  painting  of  one  swastika  or  the  dese  cration  of  any  Jewish  cemetery.  But,  he  added,  the  violence  in  Germany  had  to  be  understood  against  the  background  of  recent  events.   In  his  welcoming  remarks  Mr  Leibler  said  Australian  Jewry  was  particularly  sensitive  to  the  issues  of  Holocaust  remembrance  because,  with  the  exception  of  Israel,  it  had  a  greater  proportion  of  survivors  than  in  any  other  country.   Referring  to  the  German  presi  dent’s  speech  to  the  Bundestag  in  1985  Mr  Leibler  said  it  had  been  a  milestone  along  the  road  of  improved  German-Jewish  relations.  “Jews  throughout  the  world  admire  and  respect  you  as  an  outstanding  German  leader,  “  Mr  Leibler  said.   The  new  Germany  would  be  judged  on  its  performance,  not  on  its  past,  Mr  Leibler  said.  But  Jews  must  never  suggest  that  reconcilia  tion  could  be  achieved  by  forgiving  or  forgetting.   “In  this  sense,  our  meeting  with  you  today  is  an  important  step  in  the  ongoing  process  of  reconcilia  tion.  And  while  there  cannot  be  a  total  normalisation  of  relations  dur  ing  our  generation,  we  Jews  recog  nise  the  progress  made  by  Germain  leaders  who  have  tried  to  educate  towards  a  sense  of  history  and  morality  among  young  Germans,""   Mr  Leibler  said.",1993-09-10T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/261617318,"THE STRENGTH of today’s German democracy was the best defence against any threat of neo-Nazism, Germany’s President Richard von",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article261617318?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1990-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1999-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The Australian Jewish News (Sydney, NSW : 1990 - 2008)",122.64891815185547,very relevant

132461950,German inflation beaters,"  German  inflation  beaters   By  WILL  HUTTON   LONDON,  Thursday:  Two  years  ago  Germany  was  written  off  as  the  sclerotic  giant  that  could  recover  its  economic  dy-  namism  only  if  it  ""Thatcher-  ised""  its  corporatist  economic  structure.   Today,  it  is  beginning  to  re-  sume  its  role  as  the  feared  su-  per  competitor.   The  source  of  comparative  ad-  vantage  is  simple:  it  is  the  country's  capacity  to  mobilise  resources  for  investment,  giving  it  the  highest  capital  stock  per  worker  in  Europe.   The  debate  about  whether  the  resulting  wages  and  social  wel-  fare  system  are  too  expensive  is,  in  a  sense,  besides  the  point.   Germany  has  an  investment  system  which  gives  it  the  wealth  for  such  complaints  to  be  possible.   The  key  is  the  mobilisation  of  huge  flows  of  cheap,  low-mar-  gin,  long-term  bank  finance  to  support  the  build-up  of  industri-  al  capital.   The  German  ""Mittelstand"",  the  family  owned  medium-sized  companies  which  form  the  back-  bone  of  German  industry,  is  a  beneficiary  of  the  system  as   much  as  the  giant  international  combines.  Herein  lies  the  source  of  German  productivity  and  innovation.   It  is  also  why  there  is  such  a  strong  financial  and  industrial  interest  in  low  inflation.  Lend-  ing  long-term  loans  is  not  very  easy  if  the  price  level  keeps  in-  creasing  in  an  unstable  and  un-  predictable  way  —  if  the  loan's  value  halves  in  real  terms  over  its  life,  then  making  such  a  loan  is  inherently  unattractive.   The  more  long-term  the  loan,  the  greater  the  risk  —  and  thus  the  greater  the  interest  in  infla-  tion  being  low.   Thus,  the  success  of  the  Bun-  desbank,  praised  by  the  British  Right  for  its  anti-inflationary  credentials,  is  less  a  result  of  its  being  independent  than  be-  cause  it  is  part  of  the  anti-infla-  tionary  system  upon  which  Ger-  man  industrial  success  is  built.   Hence,  the  strong  desire  to  back  it  —  and  the  wariness  of  substituting  a  single  European  currency  for  the  Deutschemark.  Inflation  would  undermine  the  source  of  Germany's  compara-  tive  advantage.   The  commitment  of  the  sys-  tem  to  providing  long-term  debt   finance  to  raise  investment  lev-   els  is  breathtaking.  The  IKB,  for  example,  is  an  industrial  in-  vestment  bank  with  a  100  loan  salesmen  making  between  three  to  five  visits  a  day  trying  to  sell  Mittelstand  companies  long-term  loan  packages.   The  margin  on  IKB's  lending  is  1  per  cent.  Margins  are  bid  down  by  keen  competition  be-  tween  the  big  regional  Landes-  banks,  the  specialist  industrial  banks  in  some  regions,  the  local  municipal  savings  banks  and  the  big  three  commercial  banks  —  the  Deutsche,  Dresdner  and  Commerzbank.   Each  has  a  mandate  to  serve  particular  markets  —  for  small  business  or  for  giant  industrial  combines,  but  there  is  a  com-  plex  system  for  ""refinancing""  them  so  they  can  get  the  long-term  deposits  to  lend.   For  example,  the  Kreditan-  stalt  fur  Wiederaufbau,  the  re-  construction  bank,  specialises  in  packages  of  long-term  fi-  nance  —  partly  raised  from  the  Frankfurt  money  markets  and  partly  subsidised  by  govern-  ment  —  which  can  be  used  for  everything  from  export  finance  to  social  housing.   This  avalanche  of  cheap  long-term  debt  allows  firms  to  be  choosy  about  the  terms  on  which  they  raise  money  from  the  alternative  source  of  fi-  nance  —  the  stock  market.   Few  medium-sized  companies  have  more  than  half  their  shares  quoted  on  the  stock  mar-  ket,  and  those  that  do  are  care-  ful  to  issue  as  many  as  possible  without  voting  rights.   Most  search  for  a  bank,  in-  surance  company  or  partner  who  will  hold  a  large  block  of  equity  as  a  long-term  invest-  ment.  Virtually  no  German  company  has  a  majority  of  its  voting  equity  freely  traded  be  tween  a  floating  population  of  owners.  Takeover  becomes  more  difficult,  another  bias  to  ""long-  termism""  and  more  investment.   This  is  the  content  in  which   owners  and  managers  consult   with  their  workforces  in  works  councils.  Ownership  is  secured.  Long-term  finance  is  plentiful.  Investment  rates  are  high.   The  task  is  to  get  the  best  from  the  human  capital  work-  ing  in  the  firm  —  hence  the  commitment  of  both  parties  to  exchanging  information  and   consulting.   —  The  Guardian",1995-01-27T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/132461950,"LONDON, Thursday: Two years ago Germany was written off as the sclerotic giant that could recover its economic",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article132461950?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1990-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1999-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,The Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995),122.64876556396484,very relevant

261545859,German shule rededicated,"  German  shule  rededicated   Igal  Avidan   Berlin:  THE  synagogue  in  the  Bavarian  town  of  Ermreuth,  which  was  destroyed  during  the  Holo  caust,  was  rededicated  recently  under  tight  security  measures.   At  the  ceremony,  the  Bavarian  interior  minister,  Gunther  Beck  stein,  and  a  number  of  officials  from  the  American  Embassy  expressed  their  solidarity  with  the  Jewish  people.   Several  descendants  of  former  Jewish  citizens  of  Ermreuth,  which  is  located  near  Nuremberg,  made  the  journey  there  for  the   dedication.   These  included  Malcolm  Hoen  lein,  executive  vice  chairman  of  the  Conference  of  Presidents  of   Major  American  Jewish  Organisa  tions  and  members  of  his  family.  Hoenlein’s  great-great  grandfather  established  the  synagogue  in  1822  and  his  grandfather  ran  services  there  earlier  this  century.   The  shule  was  destroyed  on  Kristallnacht,  the  massive  pogrom  that  enveloped  much  of  Germany  in  November  1938.  It  was  rebuilt  and  rededicated  largely  as  a  result  of  the  non-Jewish  citizens  of  Ermreuth.

At  the  ceremony,  the  Bavarian  interior  minister,  Gunther  Beck  stein,  and  a  number  of  officials  from  the  American  Embassy  expressed  their  solidarity  with  the  Jewish  people.   Several  descendants  of  former  Jewish  citizens  of  Ermreuth,  which  is  located  near  Nuremberg,  made  the  journey  there  for  the   dedication.   These  included  Malcolm  Hoen  lein,  executive  vice  chairman  of  the  Conference  of  Presidents  of  Major  American  Jewish  Organisa  tions  and  members  of  his  family.  Hoenlein’s  great-great  grandfather  established  the  synagogue  in  1822  and  his  grandfather  ran  services  there  earlier  this  century.   The  shule  was  destroyed  on  Kristallnacht,  the  massive  pogrom  that  enveloped  much  of  Germany  in  November  1938.

After  1933,  of  course  not.  It  was  not  easy  to  make  protests  from  behind  the  barbed  wire  fences  of  Buchenwald  and  Dachau,  where  the  Nazis  incarcerated  and  mur  dered  thousands  of  their  political  opponents  —  Socialists,  Com  munists,  religious  oppositionists   and  others.   In  practical  terms,  resistance  to  Hitler  could  come  only  from  the  political  right,  the  same  end  of   the  spectrum  as  Hitler  himself,  because  that  was  all  that  remained  after  the  physical  removal  of  both  the  centre  and  the  left  from  the  political  arena.   Before  1933?  One  of  the  great  tragedies  of  modem  German  his  tory  is  that  the  Social  Democrats  and  the  Communists,  who  togeth  er  could  possibly  have  stopped  Hitler,  wasted  far  too  much  ener  gy  attacking  each  other.  Hindsight   has  shown  that  the  reasons  for   this  split  were  quite  spurious,  dic  tated  on  the  one  hand  by  an  inap  propriate  sense  of  honour  and  on  the-other  by  fealty  to  the  strategy  of  the  Comintern.   But  neither  group  spared  the  Nazis  in  their  press  and  public  statements.  The  names  of  play  wright  Bertolt  Brecht  and  artists  John  Heartfield  and  Kathe   Kollwitz  are  only  three  among  hundreds  of  German  anti-Nazi  publicists,  all  of  them  associated  with  the  left,  that  come  to  mind.

261340723,German crimes trial,"  German  crimes  trial   ACCUSED  Nazi  war  criminal  Jo  sef  Schwammberger  was  indicted  last  month  in  court  at  Stuttgart,  West  Germany,  on  charges  of  murdering  “at  least  50  Jews”  dur  ing  World  War  II.  He  also  was  charged  as  an  accessory  to  the  murder  of  at  least  3,377  other  peo  ple,  according  to  the  World  Jew  ish  Congress,  which  learned  of  the  indictment  from  the  Jewish  com  munity  of  West  Berlin.  Schwamm  berger  admitted  to  ordering  the  execution  of  one  person  under  “special  circumstances,”  but  other  than  that,  “he  has  completely  de  nied  his  crimes,”  according  to  Hel  mut  Kronbacher,  spokesman  for  the  prosecutor’s  office.   Schwammberger,  78,  who  is  be  ing  held  at  the  Stammheim  maxi  mum  security  prison,  was  extradited  from  Argentina  in  May,  after  a  long  proceeding  that  in  cluded  his  hospitalisation  in  an  Ar  gentine  hospital  for  a  mysterious  coma.  The  Stuttgart  court  found  him  fit  to  stand  trial.  The  prosecutor’s  office  said  the  trial  would  probably  begin  early  next  year.  That  would  likely  make  Schwammberger  the  first  alleged  Nazi  war  criminal  to  be  tried  in  a  unified  Germany.  A  guilty  verdict  would  bring  a  life  sentence.   A  former  lieutenant  in  the  Waf  fen  SS  and  commandant  of  several  concentration  camps  in  Poland,  Schwammberger  allegedly  was  known  for  his  particularly  cruel  killings  of  Jews.  He  has  been  ac  |  cused  by  survivors  of  camps  of   Jewish  areas  in  the  Polish  towns  of  Przemysl,  Mielec,  Rozwadow  and  Stalowa-Wola  of  smashing   children’s  heads  against  walls,  throwing  people  alive  into  fires  and  shooting  people  point-blank.  Witnesses  said  they  saw  Schwammberger  use  pliers  to  re  move  gold  teeth  from  prisoners.  He  was  known  as  the  “butcher  of  Rozwadow.”   After  the  war,  Schwammberger  was  arrested  in  Austria  with  bags  of  jewellery  stolen  from  Jews,  which  he  admitted  under  question  ing.  He  escaped,  probably  in  1948,  to  Argentina  with  what  is  believed  to  have  been  help  from  Odessa,  a  Nazi  fugitive  network.  Before  escaping  detention  in  1945,  Schwammberger,  an  Austrian  by  birth,  admitted  having  shot  about  35  Jews,  according  to  the  Austrian  police.  The  Austrian  police  files  were  obtained  by  the  Anti  Defamation  League  of  B’nai   B’rith.   The  indictment  in  Stuttgart  stems  from  a  warrant  for  Schwammberger’s  arrest  that  West  Germany  issued  in  1972.  Addi  tional  charges  against  him  were  made  in  recent  years.  The  Wiesen  thal  Centre  expects  to  play  a  strong  role  at  the  trial,  having  represen  tatives  present  and  bringing  new  witnesses  to  testify,  “including  some  whom  we  recently  found  and  others  who  were  frightened  of  go  ing  on  their  own,”  Rabbi  Marvin  Hier  of  the  Los  Angeles-based  Simon  Wiesenthal  Centre  said.   “At  this  trial,  there  will  be  more  witnesses  to  testify  against  Josef  Schwammberger  than  there  was  at  any  Nazi  war  criminal  trial  of  re  cent  memory,  including  Adolf  Eichmann,”  he  said.

122354638,German terrorist killing,"  German  terrorist  killing   BONN:  Detlev  Rohwedder,  powerful  head  ofa  controversial  agency  privatising  former  East  Ger  man  firms,  has  been  murdered  by  suspected  ur  ban  guerrillas  in  Duesseldorf,  police  said.   The  Federal  Prosecutor's  Office,  which  quickly  launched  an  investigation,  said  an  anonymous  caller  to  a  news  agency  in  Paris  claimed  responsi  bility  for  the  murder  in  the  name  of  Germany's  Red  Army  Faction.   Mr  Rohwedder,  58,  was  killed  by  shots  fired  into  his  house  overlooking  the  Rhine  about  11.30pm  on  Monday  (7.30am  AEST  yesterday)  police  said.  His  wife,  Hergard,  was  wounded  but  not  seriously.   The  attack  was  another  blow  to  Chancellor  Helmut  Kohl,  whose  plans  for  a  quick  economic  revival  of  the  east  have  bogged  down  while  large  firms  there  collapse,  unemployment  soars  and  angry  workers  march  for  jobs.   As  chairman  of  the  Berlin-based  Treuhand  agency,  Mr  Rohwedder  had  the  final  say  over  the  fate  of  east  Germany's  outdated  industry  and  the  waning  job  hopes  of  its  angry  workers.   His  increasingly  vocal  critics  in  the  ex-commu  nist  east  have  described  him  as  the  callous  face  of  Western  capitalism.   Mr  Rohwedder,  a  former  Economics  Ministry  official  who  turned  the  ailing  Ruhr  steel  manufac  turer  Hoesch  into  a  profitable  high-tech  group,  was  the  most  powerful  representative  sent  by  Bonn  to  rescue  the  depressed  east.   The  growing  uncertainty  in  the  region  has   undermined  investor  confidence  in  the  mark  and  German  stocks.   Government  spokesman  Dieter  Vogel  said  Dr  Kohl  was  informed  immediately  of  the  killing  and  was  deeply  upset.   ""There  was  probably  no  other  manager,  or  maybe  no  other  person  at  all  in  Germany,  who  worked  so  hard  to  lay  the  foundation  for  the  economic  reconstruction  of  former  East  Germa  ny,""  Mr  Vogel  said.   ""This  was  not  often  recognised  in  comments  made  by  politicians  and  other  people.""   East  Germans  have  bitterly  attacked  Dr  Kohl  and  the  Treuhand  at  job  marches  in  recent  weeks  as  it  became  clear  their  region,  which  the  chancel  lor  had  promised  would  become  a  ""flourishing   AP  plctur*  Detlev  Rohwedder:  shot  at  home.   landscape"",  would  have  up  to  four  million  jobless  by  July.   Dr  Kohl,  on  an  Easter  slimming  holiday  in  the  Austrian  Alps,  has  not  visited  Germany's  new  poorhouse  since  its  voters  helped  re-elect  him  in   December.   The  communist  government  of  East  Germany  helped  train  members  of  the  Red  Army  Faction,  which  staged  several  attacks  in  West  Germany  in  the  1970s.  The  guerrilla  group  came  back  to  haunt  the  uniting  Germany  by  murdering  its  most  prominent  banker,  Alfred  Herrhausen,  in  Frankfurt  in  November,  1989.   East  Germany  gave  runaway  faction  members  a  safe  haven  and  let  them  build  new  lives  there  until,  in  the  run-up  to  unification  last  October,  they  were  unmasked  and  handed  over  to  Bonn   aumonues.   —  Reuter",1991-04-03T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/122354638,"BONN: Detlev Rohwedder, powerful head ofa controversial agency privatising former East German firms, has been murdered by suspected urban guerrillas in Duesseldorf, police said.",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article122354638?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1990-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1999-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,The Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995),122.41300201416016,very relevant

261680181,West German leader pledges united German support for Israel,"  eader  pledges  united  German  support  for  Israel   Charles  Hoffman   WEST  GERMAN  Chancellor  Helmut  Kohl  pledged  this  week  that  a  united  Germany  would  maintain  a  “close,  trustful  dia  logue”  with  Israel  and  would  “fight  without  compromise  all  those  who  spread  antisemitic  pre  judice  or  decry  the  Jewish  relig   ion  and  faith”.   Chancellor  Kohl  was  speaking  at  a  World  Jewish  Congress  meet  ing  in  Berlin,  the  first  time  the  WJC  has  met  on  German  soil  since  its  founding  in  Switzerland   in  1936.   The  principal  speakers  were  WJC  president  Edgar  Bronfman  and  Mr  Kohl.   The  gathering  was  held  at  the  initiative  of  West  Germany’s  Jewish  community  and  drew  an  audience  of  prominent  Jewish  leaders  from  Europe,  Israel  and  America.  Their  presence  signalled  that  Jews  are  prepared  to  adjust  to  the  reality  of  one  Germany,  if  it  adheres  unswervingly  to  demo  cratic  principles  and  peace.  But  the  notable  absence  of  a  few  Jew  ish  leaders  sent  a  different  mes  sage:  that  time  could  not  obliter  ate  what  Germany  did  when  it  was  last  a  powerful  united  coun  try.   Mr  Bronfman  emphasised  the  grip  of  history  when  he  observed  at  the  outset  that  “there  are  many  Jews  who  could  not  bring  them   selves  to  be  in  this  city  because  of  the  anguish,  the  pain  that  Berlin  signifies”.  He  said  he  understood  “the  intensity  of  their  anger  and  their  bitterness”,  but  added,  “We  are  here  because  we  have  some  thing  to  say  to  a  united  Ger  many.”   Although  they  delivered  their  speeches  separately,  Mr  Bronf  man  and  Mr  Kohl  engaged  in  a  dialogue  of  sorts.  Mr  Bronfman  raised  several  demands  that  he  said  the  Jewish  people  must  make  of  a  united  Germany.   “The  new  Germany  must  for  ever  teach  what  happened  [during  the  Holocaust]  so  that  the  lowest  point  ever  reached  in  man’s  inhu   manity  to  man  can  never  occur  again,”  he  said.  The  new  Ger  many  must  be  a  true  democracy,  which  means  that  “all  minorities  are  guaranteed  equal  protection  under  the  law”,  he  said.  He  also  said  the  German  people  “must  always  support  Israel.  You  must  never  help  those  who  would  help  destroy  the  Jewish  State.”   Mr  Bronfman  said  Germany   must  never  become  a  nuclear  power.  Nor  must  it  have  the  means  of  perpetrating  mass  kill  ing  or  destruction  through  bio  logical  or  chemical  warfare.  It  should  also  not  help  any  third  party  attain  such  a  capability,  he  said,  alluding  to  the  involvement  of  West  German  firms  in  the  con   struction.of  a  chemical  weapons  factory  in  Libya.   “Germany  must  enact  strong  legislation  to  prevent  such  threats  against  mankind  and  against  Israel  and  vigilantly  enforce  that  legislation.  Never,  never  streng  then  the  enemies  of  Israel!”  Mr  Bronfman  declared.  “The  path  for  the  new  Germany  should  be  clear,”  he  said.  “The  Jewish  peo  ple  pray  that  you  will  prove  that  the  world  has  nothing  to  fear,  that  you  will  follow  the  path  away  from  your  worst  traditions  and  towards  the  best  traditions  of  which  you  are  so  capable.   “The  great  challenge  is  to  build   (Continued  on  page  28)   GERMAN   (Continued  irom  page  3)   a  Germany  firmly  rooted  in  peace  and  respect  for  universal  human  values,”  he  concluded.   In  response,  Mr  Kohl  sketched  his  vision  of  the  responsibilities  of  a  united  Germany.   “It  remains  the  duty  of  all  democratic  forces  to  fight  with  out  compromise  all  those  who  spread  antisemitic  prejudice  or  decry  the  Jewish  religion  and  faith,”  the  chancellor  said.  “For  us  Germans  one  of  the  most  im  portant  lessons  of  history  is  that  a  democracy  must  not  put  itself  at  the  mercy  of  its  enemies,  but  must  actively  fight  them.”   With  respect  to  German  rela  tions  with  Israel,  Mr  Kohl  stressed  that  “close,  trustful  dia  logue  must  remain  a  key  element  of  the  Middle  East  policy  pursued  by  a  united  Germany.  I  per  sonally  guarantee  this,”  he  added.   “To  us  Germans  the  right  of  self-determination  of  nations,  including  our  own,  is  a  particu  larly  valuable  asset,”  Mr  Kohl  ex  plained.  “However,  we  are  also  aware  that  Palestinians’  right  of  self-determination  meets  its  limits  where  Israel’s  right  to  exist  is  con  cerned.  A  fair  balance  must  be  found  between  the  legitimate  in  terests  of  both  sides,”  he  said.   The  chancellor  directly  ad  dressed  the  question  of  whether  the  Federal  Republic’s  relations  with  Israel  and  the  way  it  has  dealt  with  its  Nazi  past  will  be  continued  in  the  future  by  a  united  Germany.   While  he  answered  with  a  re  sounding  affirmative,  he  admit  ted  that  much  educational  work  must  be  done  in  East  Germany  so  that  the  people  there  have  a  true  picture  of  the  terrors  and  horrors  of  the  Nazi  past,  instead  of  the  distorted  picture  created  by  the  former  communist  regime.   Mr  Kohl  also  spoke  of  the  dangers  of  rising  nationalism  in  Europe.  He  cited  “the  activities  of  the  antisemitic  [Russian]  organisation  Pamyat  or  the  riots   in  Romania  against  the  Hungar  ian  minority”  as  “proof  that  we  in  Europe  still  have  a  number  of  obstacles  to  overcome”.

127514198,German recession nearing bottom,"  German  recession  nearing  bottom   From  STEVE  CRAWSHAW   in  Bonn   LEADING  economic  fore   casting  organisations  in  Germany  suggested  on  Monday  that  the  country's  reces  sion  was  poised  to  bottom  out.  Five  of  the  six  main  economic  in  stitutes,  in  their  joint  annual  re  port,  predicted  growth  next  year  of  1.5  per  cent  -  1  per  cent  in  the  west,  and  7  per  cent  in  the  east.   Inflation  is  predicted  to  fall  slightly.  Prices  are  expected  to  rise  by  around  3.5  per  cent  in  western  Germany  and  by  4.5  per  cent  in  the  east.  But  unemployment  is  ex  pected  to  rise  further,  to  2.6  mil  lion  in  the  west  and  1.2  million  in  the  east,  giving  an  overall  figure  of  just  under  10  per  cent.   One  of  the  six  organisations  takes  a  dissenting,  more  pessimis  tic,  view,  which  is  presented  sepa  rately  within  the  100-page  report.  The  German  Institute  for  Eco  nomic  Research  in  Berlin  argues  that  there  will  be  a  further  0.5  per  cent  contraction  of  the  economy  next  year,  on  top  of  the  1.5  per  cent  shrinkage  this  year.  But  even  the  institute  tempers  its  pessimism   with  talk  of  a  turnaround  by  the  middle  of  next  year.   The  annual  autumn  forecast  of  the  six  organisations  accuses  the  Government  of  having  ""no  medi  um-term  plan""  for  its  economic  and  financial  policies,  and  sug  gests  that  it  deals  ""only  in  ad  hoc  measures"".  This  phrase  was  seized  on  by  the  opposition  Social  Demo  crats.  The  Finance  Minister,  Theo  Waigel,  preferred  to  emphasise  that  the  forecast  ""strengthens  our  belief  in  a  positive  economic  de  velopment"",  while  also  stressing  the  need  for  spending  cuts.   The  economic  institutes  argue  against  wages  in  the  east  being  brought  to  parity  with  the  west  too  quickly,  saying  the  continued  rais  ing  of  incomes  in  the  east  ""by  transfer  of  public  money  would  only  weaken  the  economic  base  in  western  Germany,  on  which  the  upturn  of  the  east  German  econo  my  will  depend  for  some  time  to   come"".   Similar  recent  suggestions  from  Oskar  Lafontaine,  deputy  leader  of  the  Social  Democrats,  have  caused  enormous  divisions  within  the  party,  with  sharp  protests  from   the  east.  East  Germans  are  indig  nant  not  just  at  their  own  standard  of  living,  still  much  lower  than  in  the  west,  but  also  because  the  west  seems  uninterested  in  their  con   cerns.   Part  of  the  forecasters'  condi   tion  for  an  upturn  is  that  wage  settlements  next  year  should  be  smaller  than  those  in  1993.  The'  tone  is  clear:  ""There  are  many  signs  that  there  will  be  no  econom  ic  relapse.""   Those  people  doubtful  of  Mon  day's  forecast  have  at  least  one  good  reason  for  scepticism  about  a  quick  upturn.  Last  year's  forecast  was  notoriously  over-optimistic:  it  predicted  economic  growth,  in  stead  of  the  1.5  per  cent  contrac  tion  that  has  deeply  shocked  west   ern  Germans.   Partly,  perhaps,  because  of  a  de  sire  not  to  encourage  higher  wage  demands,  employers'  organisa  tions  were  cautious  in  their  re  sponse  to  the  report,  emphasising  that  the  predictions  were  only  ""hopes"".

122368605,A 'German-inspired plot',"  A  'German-inspired  plot'   BELGRADE:  With  Yugoslavia  splitting,  some  people  are  more  con-  vinced  than  ever  that  Serbia  is  the  target  of  an  international  conspira-   cy.   If  Serbian  officials  and  media  commentators  are  to  be  believed,  Yugoslavia  is  now  the  victim  of  a  German-Austrian  plot  to  dominate  central  Europe  again.   The  republic,  Yugoslavia's  larg-  est,  has  traditionally  been  distrust-  ful  of  both  Germany  and  Austria,  against  which  it  fought  in  two  world   wars.   It  perceives  that  the  West  Euro-  peans  consider  Serbia,  ruled  for  centuries  by  Turks  who  wiped  out  much  of  its  impressive  art  and  liter-  ature,  as  backward.   The  supposed  conspiracy,  aimed   at  resurrecting  a  ""Fourth  Reich""  consisting  of  Germany  and  the  pre-  World  War  I  Austro-Hungarian  Empire,  is  responsible  for  Slove-  nia's  and  Croatia's  break  with  Yu-  goslavia,  TV  commentator  Mila  Stula  said.   Both  republics,  Yugoslavia's  northernmost  states,  declared  them-  selves  independent  on  June  25.   Though  Serbia  is  expected  grudgingly  to  accept  Slovenian  in-  dependence,  it  is  unlikely  to  see  ri-  val  Croatia  go  the  same  way  without  trying  to  annex  large  chunks  of  its  territory  where  ethnic  Serbs  live.   Clashes  broke  out  between  feder-  al  troops  and  Slovene  defence  forces  after  they  occupied  border   crossings  controlled  by  the  central  government.   ""German  and  Austrian  interests  are  once  again  behind  Slovenia's  and  Croatia's  secession,""  said  an  editorial  in  the  Politika  daily,  which  usually  reflects  the  opinions  of  the  ruling  Socialist  Party  of  Serbia.   A  theory  developed  by  law  pro-  fessor  and  ideologue  Budimir  Kosu-  tic,  of  Serbia's  ruling  party,  even  implicated  the  United  States  in  a  global  conspiracy  to  prevent  the  unity  of  Europe.   Even  before  Slovenia's  and  Cro-  atia's  independence  declarations,  the  Serbs  smarted  under  the  per-  ception  the  United  States  was  tar-  geting  them.   Continued  on  Page  2   'German-inspired  plot'   Continued  from  Page  1   State-controlled  media  condemned  Wash-  ington's  admonishments  that  Serbia's  elected  Government  of  renamed  communists  was  committing  human-rights  violations  and  not  observing  democratic  freedoms.   The  Serbs  also  rejected  US  State  Depart-  ment  urgings  that  they  drop  their  objection  to  the  election  of  Stipe  Mesic,  a  Croat,  as  chair-  man  of  the  federal  presidency.   They  told  the  Americans  to  keep  out  of  Yugoslav  affairs,  permitting  Mr  Mesic's  elec-  tion  only  last  weekend,  after  the  fighting  broke   out.   ""The  US  fears  that  a  united  Europe  would  be  an  unbeatable  global  competitor,""  Mr  Ko-  sutic  wrote  in  the  mass-circulation  Politika  Ekspres.   To  prevent  Europe  from  uniting,  the  Unit-  ed  States  is  backing  the  ""expansionism""  of  the  united  Germany,  hoping  it  would  tear  the  European  Community  apart.   ""Germany  is  gathering  around  countries  which  were  the  fascist  allies  of  the  Third  Reich  in  World  War  II  including  Croatia  and  Slove-  nia,""  Mr  Kosutic  said.

130554371,Monaco win for German,"  Monaco  win  for  German   Two  in  a  row  at  Monaco:  Michael  Schumacher.   By  PETER  BREWER  in  Monaco   A  superior  race  strategy  and  chassis  set-up  gave  world  champion  Michael  Schumacher  his  second  successive  victory  in  the  prestigious  Monaco  For  mula  One  Grand  Prix  yesterday.   The  26-year-old  German,  driving  a  Renault  powered  Benetton,  stumped  his  British  rival  Da  mon  Hill  with  a  shrewd  plan  in  which  he  stopped  only  once  to  refuel  during  the  78-lap  race  and  reaped  the  benefit  to  claim  one  of  the  most  con  vincing  victories  in  the  53-year  history  of  the  Monte  Carlo  classic.   Despite  troubles  which  put  him  0.8sec  behind  the  pole  winner  Hill  during  qualifying,  Schumach  er  sprinted  away  from  the  front  row  of  the  grid  and  stayed  right  on  the  tail  of  his  rival's  Williams-Renault  car  for  23  laps.   When  Hill  was  forced  into  the  pits  to  refuel,  Schumacher  stayed  out  on  the  track  and  kept  up  a  withering  pace  at  the  front.  He  was  headed  only  briefly  —  for  less  than  one  lap  of  the  3.32km-street  circuit  —  on  lap  36  by  Ferrari  driver  Jean  Alesi.   But  when  Alesi  was  also  forced  into  the  pits  to  refuel,  Schumacher  reasserted  his  dominance  and  cantered  to  a  comfortable  34.8sec  victory  over  Hill,  with  Ferrari  driver  Gerhard  Berger  36.6sec  further  back  in  third  place.   Alesi,  who  had  shown  such  promising  pace  dur  ing  qualifying,  tangled  with  Ligier  driver  Martin  Brundle  on  lap  -12  at  the  exit  to  the  harbour-side  swimming  pool  chicane.  Both  cars  were  damaged  in  the  puzzling  incident  and  could  not  continue.   Schumacher's  easy  win  was  an  anti-climatic  end  to  what  had  earlier  promised  to  be  a  close  race,   and  Hill  admitted  as  much  afterwards.   ""I  am  bitterly  disappointed,""  Hill  said,  after  ru  ing  the  Williams  team's  time-consuming  plan  to  stop  twice  to  refuel.   ""In  the  race,  our  car  didn't  match  up  to  the  way  it  performed  during  qualifying.  Once  again,  the  Benetton  team  had  a  better  [race]  strategy.""   The  bumpy  and  daunting  Grand  Prix  track  ex  tracted  its  usual  high  toll.  Only  10  cars  from  the  26  starters  were  classified  as  finishers.   In  fourth  place  was  Schumacher's  team-mate.  Johnny  Herbert,  followed  by  Mark  Blundell  in  the!  Mercedes-powered  McLaren,  then  Germany'??  Heinz-Harald  Frentzen  (Sauber-Ford).

132377478,Strikes hamstring German airports,"  Strikes  hamstring  German  airports   FRANKFURT:  Frankfurt  airport  re  opened  yesterday  after  security  staff  strikes  on  Tuesday  forced  a  one-day  closure  but  German  air  travel  contin  ued  to  be  dogged  by  delays.   Closures  at  other  airports  and  logisti  cal  problems  caused  by  the  diversion  of  flights  on  Tuesday  meant  delays  were  likely  on  most  services,  a  spokesman  for  the  national  carrier  Lufthansa  said.   Airports  in  Hanover,  Hamburg,  and  Berlin's  Tegel  and  Tempelhof  re  mained  shut  due  to  striking  security  staff.   Stuttgart  airport  was  also  closcd  for  the  first  time  since  the  wave  of  stop  pages  began  10  days  ago  —  the  longest  public  service  strike  in  post-war  Ger   many.   A  spokesman  for  the  largest  public  service  union,  OeTV,  said  his  union  was  calling  300,000  workers  out  on  strike  yesterday.   It  has  been  the  highest  number  called  out  so  far,  up  from  275,000  the  previ  ous  day.  They  were  to  be  joined  by  postal  and  rail  workers.  Public  trans  port  remained  at  a  standstill  in  major  cities,  garbage  continued  to  pile  up  on  city  streets  and  government  offices  and  hospitals  were  short-staffed.   The  Lufthansa  spokesman  said  the  airline  had  hoped  to  resume  all  inter  continental  flights,  through  Frankfurt  yesterday  but  delays  were  inevitable.   Baggage  handling  staff  strikes  was  causing  long  delays  at  other  key  airports  such  as  Duesseldorf  and  Cologne  Bonn,  he  said.   Crucial  pay  talks  were  to  resume  lat  er  yesterday  in  Stuttgart  between  em  ployers  and  unions  demanding  a  9.5  per  cent  wage  rise.   The  three  employer  groups  —  feder  al,  regional  state  and  local  government  —  have  said  they  will  increase  their  offer  at  the  meeting  due  to  start  at  4pm  (2am  today  Canberra  time).   No  details  have  been  given,  but  they  did  say  pay  raises  for  lower  paid  work  ers  would  be  increased.   The  employers  are  offering  a  4.8  per  cent  pay  package  and  news  that  they  plan  to  increase  it  has  raised  hopes  that  the  strike  could  soon  be  settled.   The  Berlin  newspaper  BZ,  quoting  government  sources,  said  on  Tuesday  that  lower-paid  workers  would  be  of  fered  a  5.4  per  cent  increase  while  the  better-paid  would  get  about  4  per  cent.   —  Retfter",1992-05-07T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/132377478,FRANKFURT: Frankfurt airport reopened yesterday after security staff strikes on Tuesday forced a one-day closure but German air travel,https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article132377478?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1990-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1999-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,The Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995),112.20699310302734,very relevant
261605131,German Jews sound alarm,"  German  Jews  sound  alarm   DAVID  KANTOR   Bonn:  GERMANY’S  small  Jew  ish  community  has  sounded  an  alarm  over  the  escalation  of  neo  Nazi  violence,  especially  in  form  er  East  Germany.   Heinz  Galinski,  chairman  of  the  German  Jewish  community,  has  urged  Interior  Minister  Wolfgang  Schaeuble  to  enforce  the  bans  on  events  such  as  the  celebration  of  Hitler’s  birthday,  which  invariably  stir  violence,  or  a  vigil  in  Munich  several  weeks  ago  at  which  the  truth  of  the  Holocaust  was  publicly  denied.   About  150  neo-Nazi  youths  and  Skinheads  were  taken  into  tem  porary  custody  in  Dresden  on  Saturday  to  prevent  a  clash  with  anti-fascists  after  they  marched  through  the  city  to  mark  the  fuhrer’s  102nd  anniversary.  About  15  neo-Nazis  were  arrested  in  Ober  weser,  near  Kassel  in  central  Ger   many,  after  a  Hitler  party  that  damaged  shops  and  parked  cars.   In  Osnabruck,  in  the  north  state  of  Hanover,  neo-Nazi  activists  at  tacked  a  group  of  Kurds  who  were  on  a  hunger  strike  to  protest  the  Iraqi  massacre  of  their  people.  Some  Kurds  were  badly  beaten  by  the  time  police  arrived  and  their  tent  was  demolished.   In  Magdeburg,  in  the  centre  of  what  was  formerly  East  Germany,  dozens  of  neo-Nazi  hooligans  clashed  with  police  after  throwing  cans  and  assaulting  spectators  at  a  local  soccer  match.  Several  arrests  were  reported.  Incidents  involving  neo-Nazis  were  also  reported  in  Leipzig,  Cottbus  and  Birkenwerda  in  eastern  Germany.   Galinski  demanded  that  the  authorities  intervene  more  forceful  ly  when  right-wing  extremists  dis  play  Nazi  symbols  in  violation  of   the  law  and  spread  anti-semitic  propaganda.   In  Munich,  neo-Nazis  claimed  no  Jews  were  ever  killed  at  Ausch  witz  and  Treblinka.  How  can  Ger  many  subject  its  small  surviving  Jewish  community  to  such  outra  geous  expressions?  Galinski  asked.   The  Jewish  leader  had  urged  the  prime  minister  of  Saxony,  Kurt  Biedenkopf,  to  ban  the  Hitler  birthday  march  in  Dresden.  Dres  den  has  become  the  centre  of  neo  Nazi  activity,  which  spread  after  the  Communist  regime  was  ousted  from  East  Germany  in  1989.  In  re  cent  weeks,  visitors  from  Poland  have  been  attacked  in  eastern  Ger  many  after  the  country  abolished  visa  requirements  for  them.   Sociologists  have  blamed  the  emergence  of  right-wing  extremism  in  the  former  Communist-ruled  territory  on  unemployment,  poor  living  conditions  and  the  collapse  of  state  and  parental  authority.

On  a  student  exchange,  she  is  going  to  school  at  St  Joseph's  College.  She  said  people  started  celebrating  Christmas  on  December  24,  usually  by  going  to  church  in  the  evening.  Mareike  said  the  main  reason  for  this  was  because  Germany  in  winter  was  very  dark  and  the  Christmas  trees  and  lights  looked  spectacular.  In  Mereike's  part  of  Germany,  a  vvhite  Christmas  is  quite  unusual.  Because  her  grandparents  Iive  a  long  distance  away,  she  usually  celebrates  Christmas  with  her  brother,  sister  and  parents:  I  n  Germany  we  celebrate  Christmas  on  the  24th,  in  the  evening.  If  you're  religious  you  go  to  church  in  the  evening  and  then  you  go  home  and  get  your  presents.  On  the  25th  we  don't  go  to  mass.  It's  a  family  day;  you  spend  the  day  with  family.  It's  always  warm  inside  and  dark  and  cold  outside.  My  mother  usually  cooks  ducks  and  we  always  cook  cookies  with  icing.  Everyone  starts  cooking  them  in  November  and  keeps  cooking  them  until  Christmas.  People  with  open  fire-places  also  often  cook  apples  in  the  fire  or  else  in  the  oven.  Mareike  has  a  recipe  for  some  of  the  cookies  her  family  bakes  for  the  Christmas  festivities.

261951844,German honour for Goldhagen,"  German  honour  for  Goldhagen   DANIEL  DAGAN   BONN  —  The  Bonn-based  Journal  for  German  and   International  Politics  has  decided  to  award  author  Daniel  Goldhagen  its  annual  Democracy  Prize.   In  a  statement,  the  journal  said  Goldhagen,  more  than  any  other  scholar,  stirred  the  con  science  of  the  German  public  with  his  book  Hitler's  Willing   Executioners.   In  August,  the  book  sold  out  its  first  German  edition  of  40,000  copies  in  less  than  a  week  and  prompted  a  flurry  of  debate.   For  many  Jews  in  Germany,  the  book’s  value  lies  in  that  it  tells  non-Jewish  Germans  that  the  Holocaust  did  not  begin  in  the  gas  chambers  and  was  not  perpetrat  ed  solely  by  SS  officials  in  the  death  camps.   They  point  to  Goldhagen’s  suggestion  that  the  persecution  began  in  schools,  at  the  work  place,  in  stores,  at  every  street  comer  —  that  it  was  committed   by  millions  of  “simple”  Germans  from  every  walk  of  life.   Daniel  Goldhagen   Goldhagen,  whose  book  has  been  on  Germany’s  bestseller  list  for  months,  told  the  editors  of  the  journal,  “When  I  wrote  my  book  I  believed  it  was  only  about  how  to  understand  and  think  about  the  past.   “More  and  more,  I  have  come  to  realise  that  the  book  is  also   about  the  present  and  the   future.”   Meanwhile,  the  public  debate  continues  about  Goidhagen’s  the  sis,  though  with  less  intensity  than  when  the  book  was  first  pub  lished  here  last  year.   Frank  Schirmacher,  co-pub  lisher  of  the  daily  Frankfurter  Allgemeine  Zeitung,  wrote  recently:  “Goldhagen  is  building  a  new  mythology  around  the  Holocaust.  He  traces  it  back  to  the  Faustian  depths  of  German  consciousness  and,  by  doing  so,  prevents  it  from  being  dealt  with   on  a  rational  basis.”   Rudolf  Augstein,  founder  and  publisher  of  Der  Spiegel,  wrote,  on  the  other  hand,  that  while  “very  little,  one  could  even  say  next  to  nothing”  was  to  be  gained  from  Goidhagen’s  book,  “the  sim  ple  fact  that  the  history  of  the  Holocaust  is  being  gone  into  again  can  only  be  good,  and  will  certainly  cause  a  stir.   “If  Goldhagen  manages  this,”  he  concluded,  “he  will  have   achieved  quite  a  lot.

122325587,German upheaval benefits youngsters,"  German  upheaval  benefits  youngsters   A  recent  upheaval  in  the  hierarchy  of  German  hockey  has  resulted  in  a  major  reshuffle  in  the  team's  line-up  with  a  number  of  young  players  selected.   For  right-winger  Sven  Meinhardt  it  camc  as  a  real  surprise  when  he  was  invited  by  the  new  coach  to  join  the  team  for  its  tilt  at  the  Champions  Trophy  in  Melbourne.   Having  been  a  member  of  the  German  under-21  youth  team  helped  Meinhardt  as  his  coach  in  that  team  was  appointed  to  the  national  post  after  a  player  revolt  resulted  in  the  removal  of  the  long-serv  ing  national  coach.   At  19  and  the  youngest  member  in  the  squad  Meinhardt  is  regarded  chiefly  as  a   reserve  on  this  tour  but  he  has  been  used  as  a  replacement  during  this  tournament.   His  biggest  thrill  came  during  the   match  against  the  Netherlands  on  Wed  nesday  when  he  was  called  upon  to  take  the  penalty  stroke  that  enabled  Germany  to  pull  ofT  a  4-4  draw.   ""My  teammates  say  that  I  am  some  times  a  person  with  no  nerves  so  they  asked  me  to  take  it,""  Meinhardt  said.  ""Usually  I  am  about  the  third  in  line  for  strokes  so  it  was  nice  to  be  given  the  chance  with  so  much  depending  on  the   outcome.   ""We  felt  that  we  played  very  well  as  a  team  against  the  Dutch  and  have  been  very  happy  with  our  build-up  to  this  championship.   ""After  we  lost  so  many  players  through  the  administrative  problems  we  expected  to  have  a  tough  time  here  in  Melbourne  but  we  have  been  improving  with  each   match.   ""The  side  was  very  disappointed  with  the  loss  to  Pakistan  in  the  first  round  but  we  put  that  down  to  too  much  hard  work  in  the  week  before  the  tournament.   ""Our  aim  is  to  build  up  our  strength  and  experience  as  we  have  so  many  young  players  at  the  moment  but  we  are  confident  of  having  a  very  strong  team  in  the  Barcelona  Olympics.   ""This  is  my  first  tour  away  and  I  would  like  to  find  a  permanent  spot  in  the  team  to  play  in  the  Olympics.   ""They  use  me  mainly  as  a  reserve  at  the  moment  but  I  am  hopeful  of  gaining  a  regular  spot  in  the  team.  My  father  had  a  big  influence  on  my  hockey  career  as  he  was  a  goalkeeper  for  many  years  and  got  me  interested.""   Meinhardt  is  studying  for  his  A-Ievel  passes  in  Dusseldorf  where  he  is  a  mem   ber  of  the  six-times  champion  German  club  Uhlenhorst,  regarded  as  the  best  hockey  club  in  Europe.   Although  he  has  had  limited  field  time  during  this  tournament  Meinhardt  has  scored  two  goals  and  is  looking  forward  to  the  match  against  Australia  in  the  last   round  tomorrow.   Before  that  Germany  will  take  on  the  USSR  at  3pm  today  while  Pakistan  will  meet  Great  Britain  in  the  early  game  at  lpm.  A  big  win  to  Pakistan  against  Brit   ain  could  still  see  it  in  with  a  chance  of  taking  out  the  tournament.   .

261355041,German camp site safe,"  German  camp  site  safe   DAVID  KANTOR   Bonn:  FACED  with  growing  protests  by  Jews,  Gypsies  and  others,  the  state-run  company  charged  with  privatising  the  econ  omy  of  former  East  Germany  said  it  would  halt  the  extraction  of  gypsum  from  a  hill  near  the  site   of  the  former  Dora-Nordhausen  labour  camp.   The  Treuhand  company  an  nounced  in  Berlin  that  it  would   put  off  plans  to  sell  the  area  to  a  Munich-based  mining  company  until  a  satisfactory  arrangement  could  be  found.  The  government  of  the  federal  state  of  Thuringia  said  it  was  working  on  a  compro   mise  that  would  allow  for  eco  nomic  exploitation  of  the  area  while  still  preserving  the  site  as  a   memorial.   The  former  labour  camp  and  its  underground  factory,  where  the  V-2  rockets  used  against  Britain  were  produced,  is  situated  near  the  town  of  Nordhausen.  A  Nordhausen  official,  Tilo  Grosse,  warned  last  week  that  the  pro  posed  sale  would  all  but  destroy  any  hope  of  creating  a  memorial   at  the  site.   The  controversy  surrounding  the  Dora-Nordhausen  site  is  not   unique  in  East  Germany.  Efforts  to  stimulate  the  economy,  after  years  of  economic  doldrums  un   der  Communist  rule,  have  led  to  similar  proposals  -  and  consider   able  tension  -  at  other  sites  as  well.   Two  weeks  ago,  the  weekly  Die  Zeit  ran  a  front-page  article  about  the  efforts  to  build  a  shop  ping  mall  at  the  site  of  the  former  camp  at  Ravensbruck.  The  article  said  that  the  residents  of  the  area  “cannot  distance  themselves.  They  don’t  show  any  kind  of  rela  tion  to  the  inherited  burden.”   “Ever  since  1945,  we  have  been  confronted  by  our  Nazi  past,”  the  article  continued,  argu  ing  that  the  residents  of  East  Germany,  by  contrast,  have  yet  to  deal  with  that  same  past.   Commenting  on  “the  poor  mayor  of  Furstenberg,”  who  had  said  that  his  city  would  be  captive  to  the  past,  Die  Zeit  said  he  was  only  articulating  “the  wish  of  so  many  of  his  countrymen,  their  de  sire  for  a  normal  life,  unburdened  by  the  past.”  But,  the  paper  said,  “if  the  historians’  feud  has  taught  us  anything,”  it  is  that  “one  can  not  expunge  the  crimes  of  the  other.  No  person  can  escape  the  formative  period  of  childhood.

The  Australian  Class  Action  Suit,  which  accuses  263  German  industries  (including  corporate  giants  such  as  Volkswagen,  BMW,   Siemens,  Daimler-Chrysler,  Bayer  and  Krupp  among  others)  of  col  laborating  with  the  Nazis,  was  filed  under  the  US  “Alien  Torts  Claims  Act”  which  enables  non  US  residents  to  sue  anyone  who   does  business  in  the  US.   It  is,  however,  identical  to  the  American  Class  Action  Suit  filed  in   August  1998  which,  by  definition,  covers  all  members  of  that  “class”  regardless  of  their  contemporary   location.

261870058,German Army exhibit halted,"  German  Army  exhibit  halted   BERLIN:  A  controversial  exhibit  on  Hitler’s  army  will  not  come  to  New  York  next  month  because  of  charges  that  some  of  the  atroci  ties  depicted  in  the  exhibit  were  not  com  mitted  by  German  soldiers.   Last  week,  the  head  of  the  institute  that  mounted  the  exhibit  admitted  that  one  of  the  atrocities  covered  in  the  show  —  the  1941  murder  of  4500  Jews  in  a  Soviet  town  —  was  committed  by  Lithuanian  Nazis,  not  by  the  German  Army.   The  show  has  been  closed  amid  allega  tions  that  some  parts  of  the  exhibit  may  depict  victims  of  the  Soviet  secret  service.   The  exhibit,  which  is  meant  to  illustrate  the  role  that  ordinary  German  soldiers  played  in  the  Holocaust,  includes  photo  graphs,  letters  and  other  documents  from  World  War  II.  Opponents  claim  it  brands  all  veterans  of  the  wartime  German  Army,  the  Wehrmacht,  as  criminals  instead  of  honour  ing  the  vast  majority  for  serving  their  coun  try.   During  its  tour  of  Germany  and  Austria  during  the  past  four  years,  the  exhibit  has  generated  heated  protests  —  and,  in  some  cases,  violence.  At  almost  every  stop,  the  exhibit  has  attracted  neo-Nazis  who  handed  out  fliers  claiming  that  the  photos  were  fal  sified,  and  that  “our  grandfathers  were  not   criminals”.   Jan  Philipp  Reemstma,  head  of  the  Hamburg  Institute  for  Social  Research,  which  mounted  the  exhibit,  announced  the  delay  in  sending  it  to  New  York,  saying  it  will  take  researchers  at  least  three  months  to  answer  questions  recently  raised  about  some  of  the  photographs  in  The  War  of  Extermination:  Crimes  of  the  Wehrmacht  from   1941  to  1944.   Supporters  say  the  exhibit  has  raised  awareness  of  a  taboo  chapter  of  German  his  tory  because  it  proves  that  ordinary  German   soldiers,  and  not  only  the  Nazi  SS,  were  responsible  for  committing  atrocities  during   World  War  11.   Historian  Andreas  Nachama,  leader  of  Berlin’s  Jewish  community,  said  he  thought  the  exhibit  has  been  “overestimated  by  both  its  friends  and  enemies.  We  knew  there  were  many  historical  mistakes  in  it.”  Nachama,  the  former  director  of  the  Berlin  museum  Topography  of  Terror,  an  archive  and  exhib  it  located  at  the  site  of  the  Gestapo’s  former  headquarters.  “It  is  important  to  present  such  material  to  the  public.  But  you  have  to  be  very  careful,  especially  if  it  is  something  new  for  the  general  public.”   The  involvement  of  the  Wehrmacht  in  World  War  II  atrocities  has  long  been  known.  But  discussion  of  this  involvement  was  brought  to  the  fore  by  the  exhibit,  which  presented  evidence  of  these  acts  to  the  gen  eral  public.  More  than  800,000  visitors  in  Germany  and  Austria  have  seen  the  exhibit,  which  contains  1400  photos,  more  than  half  of  them  portraits.   Reemstma’s  announcement  that  the  show  would  close  came  after  an  appeal  by  a  leader  of  the  Christian  Democratic  Party,  Michael  Glos,  that  Foreign  Minister  Joschka  Fischer  “use  all  necessary  means”  to  stop  the  exhib  it  from  being  sent  to  New  York.  He  said  the  Foreign  Ministry  should  be  working  to  help  build  a  positive  image  of  Germany  abroad.  Glos  said  the  exhibit  would  only  heighten  prejudices  against  Germans  and  could  dam  age  the  good  relationship  between  the  United  States  and  Germany.   Reemstma  admitted  that  a  loss  of  credibil  ity  threatened  to  undermine  the  exhibit’s  thesis.

118191837,Distance hampers German push,"  istance  hampers  German  push   By  IAN  McPHEDRAN   Foreign  Affairs  Reporter   Moves  by  German  companies  to  use  Australia  as  a  regional  headquarters  will  be  dampened  by  distance  and  the  hierarchical  nature  of  their  head  offices,  ac  cording  to  the  German  Ambas  sador  in  Canberra,  Franz  Keil.   Last  week's  announcement  by  German  automotive  supplier  Hella  that,  it  planned  to  establish  a  re  gional  headquarters  in  Australia  was,  the  latest  in  a  series  of  moves  by  German  corporations  to  in  crease  their  stakes  in.  Australia  and  the  Asia-Pacific  region.   Hella,  which  supplies  all  Austra  lian  car-makers  with  light  and  sig  nals,  systems,  might  be  the  first  German  manufacturer  to  establish  a  regional  headquarters  in  Austra  lia,  but  German  investment  has  been  growing  steadily  from  SI.5  billioij  in  1986  to  $2.4  billion  last   year.   The  Industry  Minister,  Peter  Cook,  who  announced  the  move  by  Hella  from  Germany  last  week  said  .he  expected  Hella's  decision  to  establish  a  new  trend  for  German  companies  wanting  access  to  the  burge.oning  markets  of  Asia.   More  than  70  foreign  companies  have  established  regional  headquar  ters,  in  Australia  including  36  from  the  United  States,  20  from  Britain,  and.,  three  from  Sweden.   According  to  Dr  Keil,  who  re  tires  in  September,  the  Asia-Pacific   was  not  new  to  German  business,  but  there  was  a  growing  conscious  ness  in  the  boardrooms  of  Germa  ny  of  the  importance  and  dyna  mism;  of  the  region.   The  German  Government  launched  a  new  strategy  for.  the  Asia-Pacific  last  October  and  that  was  followed  up  by  ambassadors'  conferences  in  Bonn  in  January  and  in  Bangkok  in  April.   ""This  is  part  of  a  concerted  ef  fort  to  intensify  our  efforts  in  the  Asia-Pacific  particularly  for  small  and  medium-sized  businesses,""  Dr  Keil  said.   He  said  the  springboard  theory  for  European  companies  to  use  Australia  as  a  base  into  Asia,  which  has  been  promoted  heavily  by  Senator  Cook,  had  some  good  points  including  language  and  in  frastructure.  However,  he  believes  Australia  suffers  the  tyranny  of  distance  when  companies  analyse  access  in  to  North  Asian  markets.   ""It  is  9/2  hours  from  Sydney  to  Tokyo  and  only  lO'/i  from  Frank  furt  to  Tokyo.  There  are  many  good  arguments  in  favour  of  the  springboard  theory  particularly  for  businesses  targeting  niche  mar  kets,""  Dr  Keil  said.   Dr  Keil  cited  the  German-owned  Australian  engineering  firm,  Bauld  erstone  Hornibrook,  which  enabled  parent  company  Bilfingfer  and  Ber  ger  to  gain  a  foothold  in  the  Chi  nese  market  via  a  SI40  million   Baulderstone  Hornibrook  project.

Dr  Keil  said  a  major  stumbling  block  for  German  companies  es   tablishing  regional  bases  in  Austra  lia  were  the  restrictions  placed  on  regional  offices  by  head  office  deci  sion-makers.  ""Many  companies  cannot  delegate  power  away  from  the  head  office  in  Germany  and  that  is  one  of  the  major  complaints  we  hear  from  subsidiary  companies  based  here,""  he  said.   Germany  has  a  long-standing  re  lationship  with  ASEAN  via  the  European  Union-ASEAN  treaty  and  its  links  with  the  region  date  back  to  colonial  days  when  West  ern  Samoa  was  a  German  colony.   Dr  Keil  rejects  the  notion  that  Germany's  colonial  past  could  im  pact  badly  on  its  push  into  the  re  gion.  ""I  was  in  Western  Samoa  re  cently  '  and  the  people  there  have  only  good  memories  of  the  Ger  man  colonial  times,""  he  said.   According  to  Dr  Keil,  the  Ger  man  Government  has  taken  seri  ously  the  claims  by  Prime  Minister  Paul  Keating  that  Australia's  push   into  Asia  was  not  a  zero  sum  game.'There  is  a  growing  con  sciousness  in  the  Australian  Gov  ernment  that  focusing  on  Asia  docs  not  mean  neglecting  Europe,""   he  said.   ""The  recently  signed  treaty  be  tween  the  European  Union  and  the  ASEAN  Free  Trade  Area  creates  a  market  of  370  million  people  which  is  bigger  than  the-  North  American  Free  Trade  Area  and   vety  important  for  Australia.""   Dr  Keil,  who  is  a  former  ambas  sador  at  large  for  Asia-Pacific  in  the  German  Foreign  Office  will  be  replaced  in  Canberra  by  Klaus  Geller,  head  of  the  Foreign  Minis  try's  Asia-Pacific  desk.   .  The  appointment  of  two  Asia  experts  to  Australia  plus  the  visit  by  German  President  Richard  Von  Weizsacker  last  year  are  evidence   of  the  renewed  commitment  on  the  part  of  the  Bonn  Government  to  Australia  and  the  region:   Apart  from  the  slight  hiccup  in  relations  when  a  women's  Aborigi  nal  dance  troupe  was  subjected  to  racism  at  a  German  hotel  earlier  this  year,  the  bilateral  relationship  is  in  great  shape.   Further  proof  of  Germany's  growing  interest  in  Australia  was  the  decision  by  Economics  Minister  Guentcr  Rexrodt  to  visit  Australia  next  year.  Mr  Rexrodt  told  Sena  tor  Cook  in  Bonn  last  week  that,  subject  to  the  Government  being  returned  in  October's  general  elec  tion,  he  would  visit  next  May  for  a  conference  of  Australian  and  German  chambers  of  commerce.

261487036,Envoy defends German stand,"  Envoy  defends   German  stand   Bernard  Freedman   GERMAN  ambassador  Dr  Franz  Keil  has  rejected  a  charge  that  the  German  government  lacks   the  will  and  determination  to  deal  with  racist  violence  in  east   ern  Germany.   He  said,  however,  that  mis  takes  had  occurred  with  the  police  in  Rostock  which  were  being  examined  to  ensure  they  did  not  happen  in  future.   Dr  Keil  was  responding  to  a  protest  from  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  president  Leslie  Caplan  about  the  German  government’s  failure  to  control   the  Rostock  racist  riots.   In  a  letter  to  Mr  Caplan,  Dr  Keil  said  he  respected  deeply  the  Jewish  community’s  concern  “even  if  the  riots  in  Rostock  had  no  antisemitic  connotation”.  He  had  conveyed  the  community’s  concern  to  the  German  govern   ment  in  Bonn.   Dr  Keil  said  post-war  federal  German  governments  had  tried  their  utmost  to  foster  reconcilia  tion  between  Jews  and  Germans  and  had  always  condemned  racist  agitation,  violence  and  xenophobia  which  were  punish  able  under  the  federal  penal   code.   All  German  authorities  took  these  offences  very  seriously  and  did  everything  possible  to  bring  perpetrators  to  justice.   “I  therefore  cannot  agree  with  your  assessment  that  there  was  a  lack  of  will  and  determina  tion  by  the  federal  government  to  control  the  situation  in  Ros  tock,  even  in  its  early  stages,”  Dr  Keil  told  Mr  Caplan.   A  document  accompanying   Dr  Keil’s  letter  blamed  condi  tions  in  the  former  German  Democratic  Republic  for  local  police  in  Rostock  being  insuffi  ciently  trained  and  equipped  to  deal  with  crowd  control,  riot  sit  uations  and  rioting  extremists.   It  said  law  enforcement  authorities  also  faced  the  prob  lem  that  those  perpetrating  the  violence  were  better  organised  and  had  verbal  support  from  some  people  in  the  local  popula   tion.   The  document  said  there   were  76  “mostly  very  small  and  locally  organised  neo-Nazi  par  ties  and  organisations  in  Ger  many  with  a  membership  num  bering  40,000.   While  the  number  of  mem  bers  was  decreasing,  the  willing  ness  of  activists  to  commit  acts   of  violence  was  increasing  and  offenders  were  getting  younger.  Rostock  police  were  now  arrest  ing  14  and  16  year  olds.   The  majority  of  those  com  mitting  acts  of  violence  were  “skinheads”,  of  whom  there  were  about  3000  in  the  eastern  states.  Under  the  previous  East  German  communist  government  they  had  considered  themselves  a  “National  Socialist  opposition”.   The  document  said  the  feder  al  German  government  had  recently  provided  DM20  million  ($A22  million)  for  an  “action  pro  gram  against  aggression  and  vio  lence”   This  involved  education  and  information  work  among  young  people,  many  of  whom  were  easy  targets  for  recruitment  by  vio  lent  groups  because  of  their  “political  and  social  disorienta  tion”.",1992-09-25T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/261487036,GERMAN ambassador Dr Franz Keil has rejected a charge that the German government lacks the will and determination to,https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article261487036?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1990-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1999-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The Australian Jewish News (Melbourne, Vic. : 1935 - 1999)",112.16520690917969,very relevant
261742427,German Jews sound alarm,"  German  Jews  sound  alarm   DAVID  KANTOR   Bonn:  GERMANY’S  small  Jew  ish  community  has  sounded  an  alarm  over  the  escalation  of  neo  Nazi  violence,  especially  in  form  er  East  Germany.   Heinz  Galinski,  chairman  of  the  German  Jewish  community,  has  urged  Interior  Minister  Wolfgang  Schaeuble  to  enforce  the  bans  on  events  such  as  the  celebration  of  Hitler’s  birthday,  which  invariably  stir  violence,  or  a  vigil  in  Munich  several  weeks  ago  at  which  the  truth  of  the  Holocaust  was  publicly  denied.   About  150  neo-Nazi  youths  and  Skinheads  were  taken  into  tem  porary  .  custody  in  Dresden  on  Saturday  to  prevent  a  clash  with  anti-fascists  after  they  marched  through  the  city  to  mark  the  fuhrer’s  102nd  anniversary.  About  15  neo-Nazis  were  arrested  in  Ober  weser,  near  Kassel  in  central  Ger   many,  after  a  Hitler  party  that  damaged  shops  and  parked  cars.   In  Osnabruck,  in  the  north  state  of  Hanover,  neo-Nazi  activists  at  tacked  a  group  of  Kurds  who  were  on  a  hunger  strike  to  protest  the  Iraqi  massacre  of  their  people.  Some  Kurds  were  badly  beaten  by  the  time  police  arrived  and  their  tent  was  demolished.   In  Magdeburg,  in  the  centre  of  what  was  formerly  East  Germany,  dozens  of  neo-Nazi  hooligans  clashed  with  police  after  throwing  cans  and  assaulting  spectators  at  a  local  soccer  match.  Several  arrests  were  reported.  Incidents  involving  neo-Nazis  were  also  reported  in  Leipzig,  Cottbus  and  Birkenwerda  in  eastern  Germany.   Galinski  demanded  that  the  authorities  intervene  more  forceful  ly  when  right-wing  extremists  dis  play  Nazi  symbols  in  violation  of   the  law  and  spread  anti-semitic  propaganda.   In  Munich,  neo-Nazis  claimed  no  Jews  were  ever  killed  at  Ausch  witz  and  Treblinka.  How  can  Ger   many  subject  its  small  surviving  Jewish  community  to  such  outra  geous  expressions?  Galinski  asked.   The  Jewish  leader'had  urged  the  prime  minister  of  Saxony,  Kurt  Biedenkopf,  to  ban  the  Hitler  birthday  march  in  Dresden.  Dres  den  has  become  the  centre  of  neo  Nazi  activity,  which  spread  after  the  Communist  regime  was  ousted  from  East  Germany  in  1989.  In  re  cent  weeks,  visitors  from  Poland  have  been  attacked  in  eastern  Ger  many  after  the  country  abolished  visa  requirements  for  them.   Sociologists  have  blamed  the  emergence  of  right-wing  extremism  in  the  former  Communist-ruled  territory  on  unemployment,  poor  living  conditions  and  the  collapse  of  state  and  parental  authority.
