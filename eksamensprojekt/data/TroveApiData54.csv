199395527,GERMAN PRECEPT AND GERMAN PRACTICE.,"  GERMAN  PRECEPT  AND  GERMAN  PRACTICE.   The  ""Contemporary  Review""  for  July  publishes  a  translation  of  a  pamphlet  Herr  Meyer,  a  well  known  writer,  it  ap  pears,  on  naval  subjects,  which  has  had  it  great  circulation  in  Germany,  and  bubbles  over  with  hatred  to  England,  while  claim-   ing  for  its  writer  an  ample  participation  in  that  ""inextinguishable  enthusiasm  for  the  Good,  the  Beautiful  and  the  True,""  by  which  it  is  the  peculiar  privilege  of  his  countrymen  to  be  animated.  His  animosity  to  the  mother  country,  its  people  and  its  institutions  is  so  intense  that  he  goes  out  into  the  street  and  ""swears  at  large""  in  order  to  ease  his  mind.  As  to  her  land  forces,  heinforms  us  that  ""a  couple  of  French  army  corps  would  suffice  to  drive  the  wonderful  army  of  England,  with  all  her  Indian  and  colonial  troops,  to  the  devil.""  Whatever  reputation  it  may  have  wrongfully  acquired  in  former  days  has  van-  ished,  he  tells  us.  ""English  incendiarism  in  South  Africa  has  tarnished  the  Iast  re-  mains  of  England's  military  glory,  and  branded  her  name  as  infamous  for  all  time.  It  has  revealed  to  the  world  the  shameless-  ness  of  the  English  character  and  an  un-  ""scrupulousness  which  hesitates  at  nothing.""  Words  almost  fail  Herr  Meyer,  indeed,  when  he  endeavors  to  express  his  contempt  for  the  British  fleet,  and  his  enormous  ad-  miration  for  that  of  Germany;  while  to  those  who  are  capable  of  holding  up  the  former  as  a  model  for  the  construction  of  the  latter,  he  sarcastically  exclaims,  ""Eng-  land,  powerful  at  sea,  and  therefore  on  land  —  the  land  grabber  and  therefore  the  in-  satiable;  England,  unscrupulous  in  her  am-  bition,  and  therefore  breaking  up  in  an  ir-  reparable  decay;  England  is  to  be  the  edu-  cator  of  Germany!  Only  he  who  is  taken  in  by  the  deceptions  conjured  up  by  the  Protean  arts  and  duplicity  of  Britain  can  allow  her  to  be  capable  of  such  a  task.""  Finally,  having  exhausted  his  tolerably  copious  vocabulary  of  vituperation  in  ve-  hement  abuse  of  our  countrymen,  Herr  Meyer  winds  up  his  pamphlet  in  these  stir-  ring  words:  —  ""Unite,  German  people,  in  the  war  cry  of  Germany,  'Los  von  Eng-  land!'""  —  which  may  be  read  as  a  para-  phrase  of  the  elder  Cato's  memorable  words,  ""Delenda  est  Carthage.""  Having  listened  to  Herr  Meyer's  Anglo-  phobic  declamation  against  the  ""infamous""  conduct  of  Great  Britain  in  the  Boer  cam-  paign,  based,  as  a  matter  of  course,  upon  the  monstrous  fabrications  invented  by  Dr.  Leyds,  and  circulated  through  the  medium  of  the  reptile  press  in  Germany  and  else-  where,  it  is  amusing  to  turn  to  the  very  next  article  in  the  same  number  of  the  ""Contemporary,""  and  to  read  Mr.  Auberon  Herbert's  narrative,  mainly  drawn  from  German  sources,  of  the  atrocities  perpe-  trated  by  the  Germans  during  their  occu-  pation  of  France  in  1870-71.  ""All  movable  property  was  subject  to  demands  of  German  commanders  to  be  transferred  by  the  horses  and  labor  of  the  inhabitants  to  any  point  directed.  The  penalty  for  imperfect  com-  pliance  was  fine.  To  ensure  payment  of  the  fine  there  was  seizure  of  the  chief  inhabi-  tants  as  hostages.  If  the  village  or  town  de-  fended  its  property  the  penalty  was  burn-  ing  of  the  village.  If  any  German  troops  al-  lowed  themselves  to  be  surprised  in  any  vil-  lage,  penalty—  burning  of  the  village.  For  injury  to  roads,  bridges,  railways  —  penalty,  devastation  of  the  district.  For  wearing  a  not  recognised  uniform  —  penalty,  death.""  The  French  freeshooters  and  the  followers  of  Garibaldi  after  their  capture  by  the  Ger-  mans  were  shot  down  like  dogs.  ""Every  vil-  lage  in  which  an  act  of  treachery  has  been  committed,""  said  Bismarck,  ""should  be  burnt  to  the  ground,  and  all  the  male  in-  habitants  hanged"";  and  when  he  heard  of  the  capture  of  1200  prisoners,  many  of  whom  were  freeshooters,  he  angrily  exclaimed,  ""Prisoners!

It  has  revealed  to  the  world  the  shamelessncss  of  the  English  character  and  on  unscrupulousness  which  hesitates  at  nothing.""  Words  almost  fail  Herr  Meyer,  indeed,  when  he  endeavours  to  express  his  contempt  for  tho  British  fleet,  and  his  enormous  admiration  for  that  of  Germany  ;  while  to  those  who  are  capable  of  holding  up  tbe  former  as   a  model  for  tho  construction  of  tho  latter,  he  sarcastically  exclaims,  ""  Eng  land,  powerful  at  sea,  and  therefore  on  land  —  tho  land  grabber  and  tberoforo  tho  insatiahlo  ;  England,  unscrupulous  in  her  nrabitiou,  and  therefore  breaking  up  in  an  irreparable  decay  ;  England  is  to  be  tho  educator  ol  Gormnuy.

100489928,German Militarism.,"  German  Militarism.   Most  extraordinary  evidence  was  given  at  the  trial  by  court  martial  at  Readsbur^  of  Sergeant  Franzky,  which  ended  in  the  sen  teoce  of  five  y  eats'  imprisonment  and  degra  dation.  One  thousand  five  hundred  and  twenty  cases  of  maltreatment  of  subordinates  were  proved  against  him,  and  in  a  large  number  nf  ftARPK  lh  WAR  isliniirn  fhgt  lio  \\aA  nnvnnoWot   private  soldiers  under  him  to  lend  him  money  which  he  never  thought  of  returning.  The  same  revelations  were  made  as  in  preceding  trials  of  this  nature,  viz.,  when  the  judges  asked  the  men  how  they  could  put  up  with  Buch  treatment  when  they  had  the  right  to  complain,  they  invariably  replied  that  they  were  afraid  to  take  this  course  owing  to  the  vengeance  that  wonld  be  subsequently  wreaked  on  them.  DuriDE  drill  hours  the  recruits  were  in   mortal  terror,  for  Frnnzky  used  to  6ay  'Now  we  are  alone,'  and  then  maltreated  them  with  every  possible  refinement  of  cruelty.  During  these  periods  he  posted  two  men  outside  the  building  with  orders  to  report  immediately  the  arrival  of  the  lieutenant.  One  witness  said  he  had  been  compelled  to  carry  a  heavy  coalscuttle  for  half  an  hour  rminn  Ann  round  a  warm  mnm  Arwitliat*   was  compelled  to  stand  in  a  bucket  and  then  jump  out  aud  in  again  till  the  sergeant  tired  of  watching.  Another  confessed  to  having  been  beaten  300  times,  perhaps  more.  Another  was  compelled  to  pnlish  a  bucket  on  his  knees,  and  while  in  that  position  was  repeatedly  kicked  by  Pranzky.  He  was  also  ordered  to  go  through  exercises  in  front  of  a  warm  stove  till  he  sank  from  exhaustion.  Medical  ex  perts  say  that  this  witness  will  throughout  hia  life  be  subject  to  fits  brought  on  by  con  stant  and  brutal  maltreatment.  Franzky  spat  in  the  men's  faces  at  will,  struck  them  in  the  face  with  bis  fist  and  beat  them,  preferably  when  they  were  undressed,  with  a  broomstick,  which  he  named  '  King  Frederick  Wilbelm.'  When  thia  broomstick  was  broken  by  long  service  he  procured  an  other,  which  he  christened  '  Frederick  the  Great.'  Another  witness  swore  that  Franzky  made  him  run  his  head  sevBral  times  agaiutst  a  wall,  which,  said  the  man,  '  hurt  him  severely.  Another  soldier  who  Was  compelled   to  perform  the  same  operation  had  a  bucket  of  water  poured  o;er  his  head  afterwards  'to  cure  him  of  stupidity.'  Every  day  the  ruer  were  beaten,  struck,  or  made  to  go  through  the  most  exhausting  and  unnecessary  exer  cise,  merely  evidently  to  gratify  the  sergeant's  depraved  desire  to  witness  another  man's  pain.",1904-02-03T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/100489928,"Most extraordinary evidence was given at the trial by court martial at Rendsburg of Sergeant Franzky, which ended in the sentence of five yeats' imprisonment and",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article100489928?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1900-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1909-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,The Braidwood Dispatch and Mining Journal (NSW : 1888 - 1954),135.33221435546875,very relevant

113300874,GERMAN INTERFERENCE.,"  GERMAN  INTERFERENCE.   LONDON,  October  18.  —  Dr.  'Morrison,  the  Pe  kin  correspondent  of  the  'Times,'  recalls  that  Germany  in  deference  to  Russia's  wishes  in  1901,  affirmed  that  Manchuria  was  outside  the  Anglo-German  agreement.  Now,  for  the  pur   pose  or  embarrassing  Great  Britain,  Germany  has  persuaded  China  that  if  the  British  treaty  with  Thibet  is  confirmed  as  it  stands  Germany  may  demand  prescriptive  rights  in  Shantung,  France  may  make  similar  claims  on  Yunnan,  and  Japan  on  Fo-kien.  Tang-shao-yi,  the  Chinese  representative  at  Lhassa,  has  been  instructed  to  seek  at  Cal  cutta  a  modification  of  the  treaty  to  save  China's  face.  The  Vienna  correspondent  of  the  'Times,'  says  that  Germany  has  possibly  over-reached  herself  in  exerting  pressure  on  China  at  this  juncture.

Russia  and  Great  Britain  as  great  Asiatic  Pow  ers  admit  that  they  have  a  mutual  right  to  speak  with  a  view  of  adjustment  of  their  own  differences,  and  both  resent  the  gratuitous  in  terference  of  a  third  Power  having  no  claim  to  speak  as  an  Asiatic  Power.  Russia  has  -informed  the  Court  of  Pekin  of  the  clauses  which  she  considers  objectionable  m  the  British  treaty  with  Thibet,  and  has  stated  that  these  objections  are  not  intended  to  imply  the  slightest  animosity  to  Great  Britain.",1904-10-19T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/113300874,"LONDON, October 18.—Dr. Morrison, the Pekin correspondent of the ""Times,"" recalls that Germany in deference to Russia's wishes in 1901, affirmed that Manchuria was outside the",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article113300874?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1900-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1909-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"Evening News (Sydney, NSW : 1869 - 1931)",135.33221435546875,very relevant

142123989,GERMAN SPREADEAGLEISM.,"  GERMAN  SPEEADEAGLEISM.   A  prominent  German  newspaper  baa  opened  oat  with,  another  hysterical  tirade  against  Great  Britain.  This  in  stance  of  spread-eagleism  might  well  be  dismissed,  as  others  have  been,  but  that  it  acquires  special  significance   from  tbe  fact  that  the  journal  in  which  it  appears  is  frequently  the  mouthpiece  of  the  Government  —  which  in  international  affairs  really  means  the  impetuous,  ambitious  Kaiser  —  and  touches  upon  tbe  vital  question  of  what  Power  really  controls  the  destiny  of  European  politics.  Great  Britain  is  warned  not  to  provoke  a  decision  on  the  subject,  because  of  the  world  wide  significance  and  effect  attaching  to  it.  In  other  words  Germany  infer  entially  threatens  that  if  the  issue  is   provoked  Bhe  will  contest  any  decision  adverse  to  her  aspirations  in  that  con  nection.  Tbe  greatest  of  the  Kaiser's  many  ambitions  is  unquestionably  that  Germany  should  gain  that  indefinite,  yet  all  important,  quality  known  as  the  '  balance  of  power.'  Every  move  in  policy,  every  increase  of  the  navy  and  the  army  is  conceived  with  that  objective  in  view;  it  is  almost,  if  not  quite,  an  obsession  with  the  Monarch.  How  far  this  spirit  and  the  prepara  tions  which  How  from  it  can  ba  effec   tive,  must  remain  iu  uuuoi  uum  ??  test  has  been  applied.  In  tbe  interim  Germany  remains  the  cause  of  unrest  amongst  the  nations,  and  because  of  her  strenuousnesss  in  almost  every  part  of  the  world  has  to  be  closely  watched,  even  by  the  smaller  powers.  It  can  well  be  understood  that  a  nation  with  such  ambitions  as  Germany  has  chafes  under  the  '  diplomatic  net  '  which  has  been  woven  around  her,  and  for  which  Great  Britain  has  to  thank  the  late  Lord  Salisbury,  whose  apprecia  tion  of  the  importance  of  the  Empire's  relations  with  the  other  Powers  has  resulted  in  the  creation  of  what  is  ad  mitted  to  be  the  ablest  diplomatic  service  in  the  world.  That  service  has  unquestionably  checkmated  Ger  many,  maintained  Great  Britain's   prestige  and,  by  .the  intervening  of  interests,  made  her  position  more  secure  and  yet  left  an  outlet  for.  the  policy  of  'grand  isolation'  which  Lord  Salisbury  considered  so  essential  to  her  supremacy.  Germany  may  at  tempt  to  capture  the  '  balance  of  power  '  by  a  revolt  against  the  tight  ening  cordon  of  diplomacy,  tbe  con  tinued  increase  -of  her  naval  and  mer  cantile  fleets,  and  her  army.  Bat  how  long  could  such  an  aggressive  nation,  inclined  to  riding  rough-shod  over  obstacles,  maintain  that  power  when  in  the  high  stirrups,  assuming  that  altitude  was  attained  9  Not  for  long,  we  believe.  So  long  as  Great   Britain  maintains  the  two-power  de  fence,  the  balance  of  power  is  likely  to  remain  with  her.  But  at  Germany's  rate  of  battleship  construction  that  position  is  being  jeopardised.  It  is  probably  Great  Britain's  realisation  of  that  fact  which  the  German  semi  official  newspaper  regards  as  provoca  tion  for  testing  the  issue  of  supre  macy,  and  for  the  spreadeaglelsm  in  which  it  indulges  with  reference  to  tbe  capabilities  of  the  army.  Though  hysterical,  however,  the  declaration,  emanating  from  what  is  frequently  the  mouth-piece  of  the  Government,  may  or  may  not  have  official  founda  tion  ;  at  any  rate  it  is  worth  noticing.",1907-03-14T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/142123989,A prominent German newspaper bas opened out with another hysterical tirade against Great Britain.

15022599,GERMAN FINANCES.,"  GERMAN  FINANCES.   Herr  Von  Koenneritz  writes   Sir,—In  connection  with  the  ""Economist's""  state-   ment  regarding  the  position  of  the  German  finances,   it  may  not  be  without  interest  to  remind  your  readers   that,  compared  with  the  estimates  for  1907,  viz.,  1,187,600,000  marks,  the  Empire's  receipts  during  last  year  totalled  1,201,100,000  marks;  that  is,  roughly  13,500,000  marks,  or  about  1  per  cent  more  than  had  been  anticipated.  Compared  with  1906,  all  sources  of  revenue,  except  two  show  increases,  as,  for  instance,  Customs  duties,  643,000,000  marks,  or  88,400,000  marks  more  than  during  the  previous  year.  Tobacco  and  cigar-   ettes  excise  duties  23,600,000  marks,  or  7,000,000  marks  more,  distilled  excise  duties  112,600,000  marks,  or  7,800,000  marks  more,  brewing  excise  duties  51,100,000  marks,  or  8,200,000  marks  more,  etc.  The  two  excep-  tions  referred  to  are  the  stamp  duties  on  revenue-pro-  ducing  stocks  and  on  Bourse  transactions,  which  together   yielded  22,900,000  marks  less  than  in  1906.  But  against  this  it  should  be  remembered  that  they  had  been  un-  naturally  high  during  that  year.  All  other  sources  of  revenue  together  show  an  increase  of  160,000,000  marks  in  round  figures,  so  that  if  we  deduct  the  lesser  yield  of  the  Bourse  transactions,  there  still  remains  for  1907  an  excess  of  revenue  of  137,000,000  marks  in  round  figures  as  compared  to  the  previous  year.  Moreover,  the  fact  should  not  be  lost  sight  of  that  of  the  new  duties  passed  in  1906,  obviously  none  were  able  to  yield  their  full  measure  of  revenue  in  1907.  This  will  only  be  the  case  in  1910,  and  not  before.  This  much,  however,  may  safely  be  predicted—that  the  expecta-  tions  which  led  to  the  imposition  of  the  new  duties  will  be  fully  justified;  in  fact,  in  some  instances,  the  yield  has  already  come  up  to  the  estimates.",1908-07-06T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/15022599,"Herr Von Koenneritz writes:— Sir,—In connection with the ""Economist's"" statement regarding the position of the German finances, it may not be without interest to remind your readers",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15022599?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1900-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1909-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954),135.33221435546875,very relevant

152033934,GERMAN INTENTIONS,"  GERMAN  INTENTIONS   The  opinion  formed  by  the  Bishop  of  Salisbury  as  to  the  trend  of  thought  in  Germany  about  war  with  Britain  comes  opportunely  by  cable  for  com  parison  with  the  mail  brought  views  of  some  other  observers  and  critics  of  Germany's  warlike  preparations.  And   it  is  interesting  to  find  that,'  leaving  out  of  consideration  the  question1  whe  ther  there  is  any  -real  desire  for  war  on  the  part  of  the  people  of  Germany,  the  Bishop's  discovery  of  'a  consider  able  desire  for  the  possession  of  such  naval  and  military  supremacy  as  might  enable  Germany  -to  dictate  to  Europe  in  a  crisis,  or,  if  necessary,  to  the   United  States,'  is  very  muchi  in  har  mony  with  what  Captain  Mahan,  an  American  thinker  and  writer  of  accept  ed  authority  on  such  subjects,  recently  addressed  to  his  fellow  countrymen.  In  an  article  in  'Collier's  Weekly,'  Cap  tain  Mahan  calls  upon  Americans  to  give  their  attention  to  the  recent  change  in  Germany's  .  shipbuilding  capacity,  as  revealed  by  the  British  Prime  Minister  and  Admiralty.  He  says  :  'j[  believe  an  extraordinary  situa  tion  ihas  been  created,  and  that  hence  forward,  if  Germany  so  will  and  can  find  the  money,  the  two-Power  '  stand  ard  of  the  Britisk  Fleet,  accepted  by  Liverals  as  well  as  Conservatives,  can  not  be  maintained.  .  -  Few  persons  realise  what  the  appearance  of  such  a  navy  as  that  which  Germany  is  build  ing  means  in  international  affairs.  The  question,  indeed,  as  not  what  she  in-,  tends;  like  other  Governments,  she  may  to  some  extent  live  from  hand  to1  mouth,  though  probably  not  eo  much  so  as  others.  The  question  is:  What  will  she  be  able  to  do  with  such  a  force?  That  is  her  meaning:  the  expediency  of  an  unknown  future,  as  yet  contingent,  and  impossible  to  fore  see.  But  though  contingencies  are  beyond  our  ken,  it  is  perfectly  know  able,  and  absolutely  sure,,  that,  should  they  be  unfavorable,  6he,  with  a  decisively  superior  navy,  will  have  the  whip  hand.'  In  'The  United  Service  Gazette'  Captain  E.  H.  James  deals  with  the  same  aspect  of  Germany's  naval  operations,  and  points  out  that  the  British  policy  ihas  been  to  fight,  'with  absolute  impartiality,  for  or  against  every  great  Power  on  the  continent,  as  circumstances  demanded,'  to  'prevent  any  Power,  or  group  of  Powers,  from  obtaining  domination  over  Europe.''  For,  in  other  words;  'our  sea  supre  macy  depends  upon  our  ability  to  main  tain  the  balance  of  power  in  Europe.'  In  the  'Insurance  and  Banking  Re  cord'  we  find  'Jotter'  advising  those  who  would  understand  the  situation  of  to-day  to  read  Ellis  Barker's  great  work  'The  Rise  and  Decline  of  the  Netherlands.'  After*  pointing  to  the  warning  of  the  fate  of  Holland,  this  writer  says:  'Presently  -we  shall  have  to  tighten  our  belts  and  set  our  teeth  and  go  on  short  commons  to  repel  a  similar  attack  ;  and,  please  God,  with  -the  same  result.  -  .  .

All  the  temperate  regions  \of  the  earth,  however;  are  now.  occupied,  and  the  Germans  realise  that  what  they  require  must  be  -obtained'  (in  the  last  resort)  by  force  of  arms.  Hence  these  preparations.  A  glance  at  the  map  of  the  world  will  show  that  there  arc  three  tracts  of  land  in  't>he  Southern  Hemisphere  which,  by  reason  of  their  slight  population,  may  bo  regarded  as  possible  objectives  of  German  imperial  enterprise.  These  are  the  two  British  colon  ial  States—  South  Africa  and  Australia—  and  the  southern  portion  of  South  America:  South  Africa  (the  possession  of  which,  we  re  cognise  as-  essentlul  ;  to  our  hold  on  India)  is  near  enough  to.  England  to  lie  readily  de  fensible  without  -an  undue  weakening.  -of  our  available  resources.  The  case  of  Australia,  however.  Is  different.  Relying  on  the  ability  t>f  thv-  mother  (:ou»j/.vy  to  protect  her,  she  has  7/Vjrsued  a  policy-  of  impossible  ideals,  and  neglected  to  secure  for  herself  the  only  roaf  strength  of  a  community—  a  large  popu-  lat'/m,  and  that  settled  on  the  land.  Aus-  trtilia  is  indeed  a  plum  ripe:  for  flicking,  but  -  ufffiRr-.'  present  ciretunsUMices  we  are  pro  bably  'strong  enough  to  resist  any  predatory  attempt  successfully,  though  the  problem  may  be  a  more  serious  one  .in  the  near  fu-  .  lure.  .The  third  tract  of  land  that  I  have  men  tioned—the  south  ol!

The  Monroe  doctrine  has  never  given  us  any  con-  -  corn,  inasmuch  as  we  have  enough  posses-  -  sions  already:  but  it  does  concern  the  Ger  mans  very  defeply,  since  it  shuts  them  out  ""  '  '  .  from  the  only  temperate  region  of  the  -earth  that  it.  is  possible  for  them  to  acquire  witli-  out  coming-  into  conflict  with  the  widespread  Vind  powerful  British  Empire.  It  seems  to  me,  sir,  that  this  is  a  fact  of  the  very  highest  importance.  May  it  not  be  '  that  the  German  fleet  is  being  built,  not  so  much  to  challenge  our  present  supremacy  at  sea  as  to  render  the  Monroe  doctrine  of  the  United  States  .  nugatory,  by  making  her  fleet  powerless  to  enforce  it?  This,  at  any  rate,  would  be  a  less  dangerous  policy  for  ,  Germany  to  pursue,  and  one  more  likely  of  immediate  success:  for  in  the  matter  of  the  Monroe  doctrine  the  United  States  '  would  stand  alone,  and  coyld  not  rely  on  our  sup  port  in  a  policy  which  has  no  pt'arfVal  bear-  '  lrtg  on  our  own  interests.

The  arguments  are  of  course  terribly  biassed  against  the  British  Empire,  but  they  overlook  one  fact  that  should  make  up  for  all  the  sins  of  England's  committing.  Where  ever  the  English  flag  floats  the  German  colonist  is  as  welcomo  as  the  Britisher;  the  German  merchant  is  given  equal  rights  to  trade  as  the  British  merchant;  his  life  and  property  is  protected,  his  religion  is  respected,  his  freedom  absolute.  When  Britain  opens  up  a  tract  of  country  in  Africa,  China  or  elsewhere,  it  is  a  distinct  gain  to  £.11  the  world.  Can  these  things  be  said  of  Germany  ?  She  owns  a  lot  of  territory  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  but  her  citizens,  as  frugal  as  industrious,  and  as  in-   telligent,  as  any  people  in  the  world,  prefer  to  emigrate  t  o  British  territory.  In  German  colonies  the  German  merchant  is  given  a  preference  over  all  other  nations,  German  goods  are  not  taxed  like  British  goods  are.  When  Germany  secures  a  tract  of  country,  that  territory  is  lost  to  all  the  world,  the  exports  thcreform  go  to  Germany  on  German  ships,  the  imports  thereto  must  come  from  Germany.  The  country  is  administered  not  for  its  own  good  but  to  the  benefit  of  its  master,  much  the  same  as  Britain  used  to  have  India  administered  over  half  a  century  ago.

127564156,GERMAN.,"  GERMAN.   Herr  Dernburg,  the  Kaiser's  Press  agent  for  America,  and  probably  one  of  the  most  blun-  dering  and  thoughtless  persons  in  the  World,  has  deemed  it  fit  to  deliver  himself  publicly  on  the  subject  of  —  tact!   It  was  at  a  meeting  of  a  league  newly-form-  ed  in  Berlin  with  a  view  to  expanding  German  industrial  interests  in  the  South  American  continent.  Herr  Dernburg,  who  had  been  elec-  ted  president,  said,  according  to  a  Reuter  mes-  sage  from  Amsterdam  received  recently:  —  'Germany  has  only  a  few  friends  in  the  world.  Feeling  in  South  America  is  divided,  and  real  neutrality  in  North  America  is  also  doubtful.  'It  is  not  uninteresting  to  note  how  Lord  Haldane  at  Manchester  explained  to  British  merchants  that  now  a  favorable  opportunity  had  come  to  snatch  away  from  Germany  her  commercial  supremacy  for  ever.  ""For  generations  to  come,  we  need  not  fear  competition  abroad,  though,  if  the  present  war  ,.?.'.  Iasts  a  long  time,  commerce  will,  at  last,  be  obliged  to  find  new  outlets,  and  the  recapture  of  the  ground  now  lost  will  become  more  dif-  ficult.  ""For  coal  and  iron  South  America  will  be  dependent  on  the  industrial  States  for  a  long  time  to  come,  and,  therefore,  the  investment  of  more  capital  in  South  America  will  be  well  worth  while  for  commercial  reasons,  and  also  in  order  to  regain  lost  ground.  ''Besides  strengthening  our  economic  influ-  ence,  the  obtaining  of  a  certain  intellectual  influence  will  be  of  an  importance  which,  up   till  now,  has  been  greatly  under-estimated.

144792699,German [?],"  German  Ideas  of  Peace   By  D.  Thomas  Curtin   It  is  a  mistake  to  suppose,  when  reading  of  peace  talk  in  Germany,  that  the  topic  is  a  new  one  there.  It  is  not.  I  heard  the  German  people  talking  peace  a  month  after  the  outbreak  of  war—of  a  peace   to  be  sure  which  Germany  would  dictate  and  keep.  When  the  Fatherland  was  winning  I  heard  no  discordant  note.  That  was  owing   to  the  general  belief  in  and  eager-  ness  for  certain  victory  and  vast  annexation  which  prevailed  then.  To-day  the  Germans  —  with  the  exception  of  a  minority  of  extreme  Social  Democrats  —  are  no  less  united  in  their  desire  to  get  all  they  can,  but  they  are  not  all  united  in  their  opinions  as  to  how  much  they  can  get.  Hence,  after  the  French  definitely  blocked  the  German  of-  fensive  at  Verdun  and  the  British  Fleet  grip  more  and  more  tightly  the  economic  life  of  German,  a     bewildering  variety  of  Kriegsziele  (war  aims)  was  discussed  by  all  classes  of  people.  The  National  Liberal  Party  in  Germany,  as  I  have  already  in-  dicated  in  a  previous  article  on  submarines,  is  backing  a  gigantic  and  aggressive  plan  for  German  world-domination  through  a  colossal  organisation  and  expansion  of  Ger-  man  commerce  and  industry.  The  great  captains  of  industry  who  con-  trol  the  party  believe  in  the  em-  ployment  of  the  German  Army  and  Navy  to  further  their  ends  —  i.e.,  to  secure  permanently  for  Germany   the  mining  regions  of  Northern  France  and  the  coal  and  shipping  of  Belgium  ;  and  to  cripple  rival  commerce,  not  only  as  a  means  of  winning  the  war,  but  also  of  limit-  ing  competition  against  them  after  wards.  These  are  the  men  behind  Tirpitz,  and  they  are  working,  and  will  continue  to  work,  to  restore  him  to  power.  Dr  Stresemann,  one  of  the  most  influential  National  Liberals,  is  a  dynamo  of  energy  in  German  com-  mercial  plans.  His  eyes  sparkling  with  zeal,  reddish  hair,  a  clear,  metallic  voice,  he  is  a  heavy  man  physically,  wielding  a  tremendous  and  growing  power  in  Germany  to-  day.  He  has  a  controlling  interest  in  a  recently  organised  combination  of  some  two  thousand  manufactur-  ing  firms,  and  is  practically  dictator  of  the  Sachsische  Handelsgesell-  schaft  and  the  Deutsch-Amerikan-  ische  Wirthschaftsverband.  He  became  one  of  theChancellor's  most  out-spoken  enemies  at  the   time  of  the  Danish  concessions  to  America,  and  his  fiery  advocacy  of  relentless  submarine  warfare  has  earned  him  a  reputation  for  fright-  fulness,  even  in  Germany.  He  be-  longs  to  the  Western  School  of  pre-  sent-day  Germany  —  the  school  which  believes  in  placating  Russia  (to  be  followed  by  a  peaceful  pene-  tration  of  that  country)  and  the  smashing  as  far  as  possible  of  Britain  and  France.  As  his  utter-  ances  in  the  Reichstag  plainly  show,  he  is  passionately  anti-American  in  general  and  anti-Wilson  in  par-  ticular.  Since  he  is  one  of  the  foremost  Germans  in  the  great  campaign  against  Great  Britain  both  during  and  after  the  war,  Dr  Stresemann's  views  should  be  of  particular  in-  terest.  His  most  recent  utterances  agree  in  the  main  with  those  he  made  in  an  interview  which  he  gave  me,  and  which  I  duly  communi-  cated  to  American  newspapers  through  the  Wilhelmstrasse.  There  are,  however,  some  important  dif-  ferences  which  I  shall  point  out   later.  ""How  seriously  do  German  in-  dustrial  circles  regard  the  Paris  Economic  Conference?""  was  the  first  question  I  put  to  Dr  Strese-  mann.  ""If  one  is  to  attach  great  import-  ance  to  the  words  of  the  political  economists  of  the  Entente,""  he  be-  gan,  ""then  we  must  agree  that  we  might  have  considerable  anxiety  and  alarm  about  our  industrial  fut-  ure;  but,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  Ger-  man  industrial  circles  view  these  endeavors  of  our  enemies  with  calm-  ness  of  indifference.  ""Russia  cannot  emancipate  her-  self  from  German  industry.  As  for  France,  she  may  look  to  a  boy-  cott  of  German  wares.  Yet  that   will  make  no  appreciable  difference  in  our  world  trade,  even  though  here  and  there  we  may  drop  a  few  million  marks.  We  have  but  to  consider  France's  tremendous  losses  in  relation  to  her  already  falling  birthrate  before  the  war  to  realise  that  France  must  inevitably  sink  to  the  rank  of  a  third  rate  Power.  ""After  the  war  Great  Britain  will  probably  stand  united  against  us,  politically  and  economically,  but  we  fear  her  just  as  little  as  we  fear  Russia  and  France.  We  rely  first  of  all  upon  the  peerless  quality  of  our  goods  —  just  think  of  our  chemical,  textile,  and  toy  monopo-  lies,  and  the  like  —  and,  secondly,  we  rely  on  our  unsurpassed  mar-  kets  for  consumption.  ""In  1913  we  imported  for  ex-  ample,  from  Great  Britain  and  her  colonies  2,109  ,000,000  marks  (£105,450,000)  worth  of  goods.  Do  you  for  a  moment  believe  that  our  rival  is  going  to  sacrifice  such  a  tremendous  volume  of  business  for  the  sake  of  a  personal  spite?  Any  tariff  war  which  is  waged  against  us  can  injure  us,  but  it  is  bound  to  injure  the  side  just  as  much.  That  will  be  realised  all  the  more  in  England,  since  these  threats  drive  us  into  a  closer  trade  and  industrial  relationship  with  our  allies,  thus  affording  us  a  greater  extent  of  united  industrial  territory  to  oppose  the  industrial  chicaneries  which  our  enemies  have  developed  during  the  war.  In  this  we  shall  undoubtedly  be  successful  at  the  Peace  conference.  ""With  the  United  States  we   shall  resume  trade  immediagelyafter  the  end  of  hostilities.  The  war  has  caused  both  of  us  to  become  un-  comfortably  short  in  some.  com-  modities.  Consequently,  the  first  demands  after  our  resumption  of  trade  will  restrict  free  competition,  since  both  sides  must  limit  them-  selves  at  first  to  importing  the  most  necessary  commodities.  You  will  need  dyestuffs,  for  example  ;  we  must  have  certain  raw  materials.  ""To  be  sure,  trade  rivalry  will  be  keen  in  other  markets,  especially  in  South  America.  It  is  there  where  immense  capital  is  necessary  for  extensive  undertakings,  and  we  fully  realise  your  advantage  over  us  for  the  present  in  this  respect,  for  it  is  you  who  have  made  the  greatest  economic  gain  out  from  the  world  war,  a  gain  which  puts  millions  upon  millions  of  ready  money,  while  bleeding  Europe  will  emerge  from  the  struggle  economi-  cally  weakened.  ""We  Germans  would  not  dispute  your  legal  right  if  you  would  balance  the  munition  deliveries  to  our  enemies  with  raw  materials  and   foodstuffs  to  us.""  Dr  Streseman  then  went  on  to  explain  that  America  did  not  really  understand  Germany  because  she  looked  at  her  through  the  ""dis-  torted  eyeglasses  Of  Reuter.""  ""It  is  only  in  British  fancy,""  he  said,  ""that  we  are  going  to  wage  war  against  Brazil  or  other  South  American  States  in  order  to  establish  colonies.  ""You  look  calmly  on  while  Britain  rules  half  the  world,  while  she  militarily  controls  the  gates  of  the  world  in  Egypt,  India,   Cape  Colony,  Canada,  and  Gib-  raltar.  In  your  opinion  that  is  all  right  ;  but  if  in  peace  time  Ger-  many  indicated  that  she  wished  a  coaling  station  or  two  to  protect  her  vast  trade,  then  half  the  press  of  the  universe  rose  in  an  outcry  against  the  German  lust  for  'con-  quest'  and  the  'world  domination'  she  wished  to  establish.  We  stand  second  in  world  trade.  In  exports  we  are  only  300,000,000  marks  (£15,000,000)  behind  England,  and  we  surpassed  her  by  more  than  3,000,000,000  marks  (£150,000,  000)  in  exports,  if  we  exclude  British  exports  to  her  own  Colonial  Emgire,  which  buys  4,000,000,000  marks'  (£200,000,000)  worth  of  goods  from  her  annually,  she  would  long  ago  have  been  defeated  by  Germany  in  free  world  competition  —  defeated,  however  not  by  unfair  methods,  but  by  the  superior  qual-  ity  of  German  goods.""'  In  the  ""Through  German  Eyes""  column  of  ''The  Times""  recently  is  discernable  a  more  anxious  strain  in  Dr  Stresemann's  remarks  concerning  the  Paris  Economic  Conference.  Russia,  in  particular,  seems  to  have  considerably  dis-  mayed  him.  The  meeting  of  the  Russo-British  Chamber  of  Com-  merce  at  the  Savoy  Hotel,  at  which  Count  Benchendorff,  the  Russian  Ambassador,  presided,  should  prove  further  unpleasant  news  in  the  Fatherland.  Note  that  Dr  Stresemann  now  says:—  'We  do  not  yet  know  the  end  of  the  struggle.  We  know  that  we  are  military  invincible.  But  wherever  an  economic  heel  of  Achilles  shows  itself  England  will  make  every  attempt  to  bleed  us  to  death.  The  peace  must  include  the  restoration  of  free  competition  in  face  of  the  resolution  of  the  Paris  Conference.  When  free  com-  petition  is  restored  nothing  can  frighten  us,  because  we  know  that  in  this  freedom  Germany  can  win  the  victory.""—  ""The  Times.""",1917-03-01T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/144792699,"It is a mistake to suppose, when reading of peace talk in Germany, that the topic is a new one there.

183612020,GERMAN.,"  GRAMAN   The  social  which  was  held  in  aid  of  the  Tennis  Club  was  a  marked  success.  Although  the  weatber  was  very  threatening  about  thirty  couples  were  present.  During  tbe  evening  a  presentation  was  made  to  the  worthy   secretary,  Mr.  W.  L.  O'Brien.  Mr.  A.  Lowe  mads  the  presentation,  and  in  a  few  fitting  words  said  that  the  Club  was  indebted  to  Mr.  O'Brien  for  his  untiring  efforts  in  furthering  its  interests.  Mr.  M.  Robson  endors-  ed  the  last  speaker's  remarks,  and  said  be  hoped  that  although  Mr.  O'Brien  was  not  actually  in  harness  he  hoped  the  CIub  would  not  lose  one  of  its  most  energetic  members.  Mr.  O'Brien  in  responding,  said  he  tried  to  do  his  best  in  the  interests  of  the  Club,  but  through  pressure  of  busi-  ness  he  was  unable  to  do  it  justice,  so  he  thought  it  better  for  the  Club  if  he  allowed  some  one  else  to  fill  his  place.  He  again  thanked  the  mem-  bers,  and  said  he  would  continue  to  do  his  utmost  to  advance  its  interests.  A  tennis  match  was  played  between  Bannockburn  and  Gratnau  last  Satur-  day.  The  game  was  very  evenly  and  keenly  contested,  and  was  won  by  Bannockburn  by  the  narrow  margin  of  4  games.  We  have  experienced  several  frosts  during  the  last  few  weeks,  and  of  course  everybody  is  wishing  winter   over,  and  the  nice  warm  days  in  its  stead.  Last  Thursday  at  the  School  at  9  a.m.  it  was  32  degrees,  a  record  for  this  year  up  to  the  present.  By  the  way,  the  local  school  garden  at  the  present  is  looking  in  tip  top  order,  although  it  cannot  boast  of  a  garden  equal  to  ""Andersons""  it  will  in  the  near  future  eclipse  many  so-  called  gardens.  At  the  present  time  the  local  school  is  half-time,  but  it  is  to  be  hoped  that  before  long  it  will  be  made  into  a  provisional.

137630151,GERMAN.,"  GERMAN.  Germany's  luck  has  been  out.  To  understand  this  we  want  to  read  history.  Had  there  never  been  a  great  Empire  of  Germany,  then  possibly  there  would  now  be  a  great  German  Empire.  We  want  to  realise  that  the  old  German  Empire  was  one  made  up  of  nations,  and  that  some  of  these  did  great  pioneerlng  work  which  circumstances  linked  with  their  individual  selves.  If  Australia  were  to  take  all  New  Guinea,  and  England  approved,  it  would  be  an  Imperial  work,  and  our  language  being  the  same,  the  latter  would  stand  even  though  ultimately  we  separated.  Some  of  the  work  of  Spain  was  done  as  part  of  the  old  German  Empire:  that  is  to  say,  the  King  of  Spain  was  also  the  German  Emperor.  The  old  German  Empire  came  too  soon  in  last,  albeit  it  did  last   in  one  form  and  another  for  ages.  Permanent  Empire  is  dependent  on  rapid  transit  and  quick  intercommunications.  Without  the  stcemboat  and  the  telegraph,  and  also  railways  in  conjunction,  the  present  British  Empire  would  be  as  impossible  as  was  the  former  one.  1t  is  forgotten  that  there  was  an  Anglo-French  Empire,  even  though  not  that  the  thirteen  American  Colonies  dissolved,  the  Anglo-American  one  to  the  extent  that  they  were  responsible  for  the  title.  German  is  the  vernacular  of  a  territorially  small  section  of  the  world's  surface.  It  is  filled  in  solid  in  the  little  map.  German  is  read  or  spoken  to  some  extent  in  the  shaded  sections,  for  the  following  reasons—  in  parts  through  old  control  and  the  continued  virility  and  influence  of  the  strain,  and  over  all  through  present  Germany's  commercial  and  flinancial  relatlonships.  To  these  we  may  add  strain  derivations,  no  matter  of  what  date,  and  the  face  that  German  has  been  responsible  for  a  great  literature.  Nevertheless  partial  use  is  not  sufficient.  Partial  use  in  Germany's  case  means  that  in  many  spheres  the  language  is  merely  classical.

Co-operation  for  the  poli   tical  and  economical  consolidation  ol  Europe,  ishc  urges,  is  impossible  'without  the  immediate  evacuation  of  Allied  troop;  from  German  territory.  Germany  is  drilling  to  be  friendly,  but  resents  having  to~  bear  the  brand,  and.  burden  of  the  conquered.  Although  she  can  honestly  claim  to  have  attempted  to  make  the  reparations  plan  work,  and.  tc  be  a  fviHing  partner,  in  the  Locarno  treaties  and  a  respected  member  of  the  League  of  Nations,  she  is  not  unmind  ful  of.  the  strength  of  the  .opposition  still  offered  ""  to  her  restoration,  ;  to  '  inter  national  equality.

The  challenge  may  not  be  answered  as  promptly  as  lie  would  like;  but  it  will  doubtless  assist  in  the  inevit   able  readjustment  of  European  relatione,  j  The  plea  is  firm;  yet  it  is  significantly  j   dispassionate,  and  bCars  no  trace-of  the:  aggressiveness  which  has  marred  the   effect  of  previous  similar  pronounce-j  ments.  In  tliis  respect,  it  confirms  the  I  signs  of  the  new  spirit  of  reason  mani  fest  in  recent  developments  in  German  politics.  :  The  members  of  the  last!

187921698,GERMAN REALISM,"  GERMAN  REALISM   ""Winter,""  by  P.  Griese.  Translated  from  tbo  German  by.Adler  Hobman-  Published  by  Long  mans,-  London,  >   A  book  .as  powerful  as  it,is  gloomy  has  been  written  by  a  German  school*  master  who..has  found  his  metier  as  a  novelist,  Griese.  is  a  realist,  with  vivid  »pen  which  is  used  with  the  -  sparing  economy  of  the  artist  and  the  imagina  tion  of  the  poet.  Ilis  picture  of  an  obscure  and.isolated  farming  village  through  a  summer  of  drought  followed  by  an  early  winter  of  phenomenal  severity  will  not  readily  fade  from  the  'mind  of  those  who  absorb  his  pene  trating  chapters.  The  people  upon  whom  this  natural  affliction  is  visited  arc  purely  of  the  soilt  simple,  superstiti  ous,  self-centred,  almost  primitive  >in  their'  loves  and  •  hates.  •  The  stark  tragedy  of  that  awful  winter  which  left  the  farms  desolate  and  deserted  Is  matched  by  the  grimness  of  the  per  sonal  histories  unfolded.  Men  and  women  alike  have  the  stolidness  com-?  mon.  to  the  uneducated  and  specially  characteristic'  of  the  German  rustic,  and  from  this  quality  the  author  has  weaved  material  that  has  all  the  elements  of  social  drama.  The  hero  Jona  is  the  illegitimate  offspring  of  a  farmer's  daughter  and  an  .  alien  labourer  who  had  been  turned  from  the  farm-  when  his  attentions  to  .the  girl  became  apparent.  Jona  has  all  the  in  articulateness  .of  the  countryman  and  withstands  every  effort  to  induce  him  to  set  about  getting  a  wife.  Clearly  he  likes  Grita,  a  neighbouring  farmer's  daughter,  but  hesitates  to  speak,  and  a  less  unwilling  wooer  in  his  cups  forces  his  attentions  on  her  with  a  crudity  which  leaves  Grita  in  her  unr  sophisticated  simplicity  with  no  alter  native  but  to  marry""  the  man.  But  she  determined  to  be  wife  .  only  in  name  and  a  grim  scene  on  her  wedding,  night  is  only  averted  by  the  worse  tragedy  of  the  discovery  that  a  wronged  younger  sister  has  killed  herself  under  stress  of  taunts  at  the  wedding  supper  table.  Grita  and  her  Thord  in  their  estranged  relations  presents  a  ""strange  commentary  on  village  heroics,  -and  the  tense  situation  is  ended  by  Jona  fighting  him  to  the  death.  Out  of  the  village  in  which  relentness  snow  storms  had  wrought  despair  and  star  vation  the  victor  and  Grita  pass  ""into  some  shadowy  prospect  of  a  happier  future.  The  story  is  a  masterpiece  .of  fiction  and  carries  the  commendation  of  having  won  two  literary  prizes.  •",1929-06-07T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/187921698,"""Winter,"" by F.

232435291,GERMAN REPARATIONS,"  GERMAN  REPARATIONS   What  should  Germany  pay?  In  theory,  the  whole  cost  of  the  war  which  she  provoked.  But  the  bitter  truth  was  long  ago  recognised—first  by  Britain  and  last  of  all  by  exasper  ated  France—that  neither  Germany  nor  anyone  else  could  possibly  foot  the  whole  bllL  Moral  obligation  had  to  give  way  to  potential  fact,  and  the  question  became  not  what  ""should'  but  what  ""can""  Germany  pay?  That   matter  was  closely  studied  through  long  years,  averaging  and  calculatin;  on  a  basis  entirely  business-like,  ant'  fixed  amounts  were  determined,  fai  below  the  fair  but  touching  only  the  possible.  No  one  expected  the  Germans  to  welcome  this  minimum,  but  at  least  it  was  thought  that  they  would  feel  that  they  had  done  pretty  well  in  comparison  .with  what  might  have  been  insisted  on  (and  what  they  themselves  would  have  exacted,  if  victorious,  from  others).  Acceptance  of  the  Inevitable  should  surely  have  been  their  proper  course.  Instead  of  this,  however,  we  find  ourselves  face  to  face  with  new  demands  for  further  remissions.  An  Insidious  campaign  'in  forma  pauperis""  has  been  steadily  afoot  Against-this,  the  French  have  unceasingly  .protested,  though  in  England  a  certain  degree  of  sympathy  has  at  times  been  mildly  shown.  British  opinion,  however,  has  now  been  considerably  stiffened  by  the  Parker  Gilbert  report  That  document,  apart  altogether  from  its  highly  convincing  business  side,  merely  puts  into  words  the  justifiable  conviction  of  the  average  Briton,  who,  not  at  all  disposed  to  kick  even  the  most  ruthless  enemy  when  down,.  Is  nevertheless  quite  tinable  .to  see  why  the  losers  of  a  wanton  and  deliberate  war  should  suffer  from  its  effects  In  a  less  degree  than  those  who  ltchleTed  a  defensive  victory.  Forthatwas  all  that  the  Allies  gained  br,could  gain  —  successful  resistance,to  ^threatened  destruction.:  In  gaining:  tt^toiey';«^p)£nitned  themselves,  nonejnoreso  than  Britain.  And  It  certainly  the  TOrr  Climaxof  unreason  that  reparations  (there  Is  no  question  ol  ^nflemnitles)  which  have  already  bpen^ifeed  flown  to  tar  betow  &e  st&3ard  i>f  :«hat  would  have  been  :  righ^i^  jMtlce  should  t>e  the  iBeonans  .  gome-   what  inconvenient  All  tiie  evidence  suggests  that  Britain  is  even  yet  bear  ing  heavier  burdens  than  they,  having  lost  some  of  her  markets  even  to  the  Germans  themselves.  At  present:  most  of  Britain's  sympathy  and  concern  are  sorely  needed  for  lier  own  family,  and  -what  there  is  over  and  to  spare  may  well  be  extended  rather  to  Germany's  victims  than  to  Germany.  This  is  cold  justice,  not  hot  vindictiveness.  Britain  does  not  bear  ill-will.  Hp  to  almost  the  outbreak  of  the  war,  Germany  had  her  friendship,  for  the  mass  of  our  ""people  disregarded  all  warning.  That  friend  ship  she  deliberately  destroyed  though  even  already,  after  all  that  has  happened,  there  arc  signs  that  she  may  gradually  recover  it  if  she  conducts  herself  with  ordinary  sense.  She  won  back  a  certain  amount  of  respect  from  the  discerning  by  her  refusal  tc  go  Bolshevik  at  a  time  when  temptation  pointed  to  that  course  as  s  possible  escape  from  all  debts  whatever.  Having  resisted  that,  her  pose  of  mendicancy  comes  with  all  the  poorer  spirit.  Nor  •will  it  be  accept  ed.  The  mere  proposal  has  united  the  Allies  more  closely  again,  drawn  Britain  nearer  to  the  French  point  ""of  vie.  Germany  has  hitherto  been  remarkably  lucky,  not  through  deserv   ings  but  by  force  of  circumstances  She  ought  to  recognise  that,  and  not  to  lodge  appeals  which  border  very  closely  on  presumption.",1929-01-05T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/232435291,"What should Germany pay?

""Her  people  are  working  harder  than  any  others,  at  lower  wages,  and  with  more  efficient  organisation.  They  have  been  braced  by  defeat,  whereas  the  victor  nations,  and  above  all  Great  Britain,  have  been  slackened  by  victory,""  he  writes  in  the  ""Review  of  Reviews.""  The  Change  in  the  People.  ""When  I  went  first  into  Germany  after  the  armistice  the  people  seemed  stupefied  by  what  had  befallen  them.  All  their  faith  had  been  shattered  by  the  downfall  of  their  armies,  and  they  were  afraid  of  revolution,  and  hopeless.  ly  uncertain  of  the  future.  Many  of  them,  ;especially  the  women  and  chil  dren,  were  still  suffering  from  the  effects'  of  long  under-feeding,  ,prices  of  food,  clothing,  and  other  necessities  of  life  were  above  the  reach  of  working  folk,  demobilised  soldiers  were  not  yet  assimilated  into  civil  life.  and  the  spirit  of  the  people  was  dejected  and  de  spairing.  ""Now,  in  Berlin  the  general'  appear  ance  of  the  people  is  not  miserable  but  cheerful,  not  dejected  but  alert  and  con  fident.  One  does  not  see  crowds  of  listless  unemployed  men  hanging  about  labour  exchanges  or  rattling  collecting  boxes  in  the  faces  of  the  passers-by.  One  sees  crowds  of  men  stepping  out  briskly,  obviously  employed,  well-dressed,  well-fed,  keen""  on  their  jobs,  doing  good  business.  Krupp's  5s.  Day.  ""The  German  working  man  in  Krupp's  factories  and  others,  is  paid  60  marks  a  day.  At  the  old  value  of  the  mark  that  would  be  £3.  At  the  present  value,  inside  Germany  itself,  I  reckon  it  as  five  shillings.  ""For  an  eight-hour  day  it  works  out  at  74d.  an  houi  compared  with  1s.  9d.  to  2s.  6d.  an  hour  of  the  mechanic  in  \Great  Britain.  ""The  German  working  man  on  60  marks  a.  day  gets  almost  enough  to  eat  (never  enough  meat),  almost  enough  to  support  a  wife  and  small  family,  almost  enough  to  make  himself  satisfied'  with  his  job.  By  strict  attention  to  economy,  he  can  squeeze  out  a  few  marks  for  the  simple  pleasures  of  his  leisure  hours,  which  consist  mostly  in  light  beer  and  light  music  in  some  public  garden  or  beer-hall.  ""The  professional  classes,  and  the  clerical  classes  (city  clerks,  typists,  etc.)  are  not  so  well  off  relatively  as  the  mechanics'  and  labourers.  Whereas  the  cost  of  living  has  increased  from  eight  to  10  times,  the  salaries  of  professors,  teachers,  civil  .servants,  and  others  have  only  risen  from  4  to  6  times.  It  is  they  who  are  most  pinched  'and  reduced  to  desperate  straits  in  order  to  'keep  up  appear  ances.  .  A  New  Industrial  Organisation.  ""Now,  upon  the  great  mass  of  cheap  labour  German  capitalists  are  building  up  a  new  and  intensive  sytem  .of  indus  trial  organisation,  beyond  anything  the  world  has  previously  seen  in  efficiency  and  driving  power.  Hugo  Stinnes,and  his'great  Trust,  controlling  a  vast  mo  nopoly  of  coal,  iron  and  steel,  of  whom  there  has  been  much  talk,  because  he  re  presents  most  powerfully  'this  new  phase  of  German  energy,  is  only  one  of  a  score  of  other  magnates  who  prac  tically  control  the  whole  industrial  life  of  .Germany,  and  are  the  real  rulers  of.  the  State.  ""Their  method  is  what  is  described  as  the  creation  of  'vertical'  trusts.  That  is  to  say,  by  a  combination  and  pool  ing  of  many  companies  in  possession  of  raw  material  and  industrial  plant  they  build  up  an  immense  production  .of  manu  factured  articles  which  have  that  raw  material  as  their  basis.  Krupp's  Peaceful  Output.  ""Thus  the  great  munition  works  of  Krupp,  entirely  engaged  in,  the  produc  tion  of  guns  and  armaments  during  the  war  'bon  a  colossal  scale,  read  the  lesson  of  defeat,  and  within  a  few  months  after  the  Armistice,  adapted  their  plant  and  their  organising  genius  in  a  marvellous  way  to  the  requirements  of  peace.  They  are  now  making  engines  and  machinery  of  all  kinds,  agricultural  implements,  cash  registers,  safety  razors,  and  any  kind  of  article  in  iron  and  steel  for  which  there  is  a  world  market.  The  General  Electric  Company  is  also  de  veloping  its  energy  with  gigantic  strides,  reaching  out  to  'neutral'  countries  and  absorbing  many  industrial  concerns  of  which  the  basis  of  activity  is  coal  and  iron  and  electrical  power,  in  Austria,  Hungary,  and  other  countries..  ""These  great  Trusts,  are  already  cap  turing  the  world's  markets,  and  have  already  succeeded  in  recovering  some  of  the  pre-war.  prosperity  of  German  trade-which  is  almost  a  miracle  con  sidering  the  ruin  of  the  German  economic  system  by  the  exhaustion  of  a  bloody  and  unsuccessful  war,  the  loss  of  colonies,  shipping,  and  foreign  pro  perty,  the  loss  of  man  power,  and  the  deterioration  of  machinery,  railways,  and  rolling  stock.  Imports  Falling  Off.  '¶masing  as  all  this  is,  however,  one  must  not  exaggerate  the  actual  results.  Germany  is  not  rolling  in  wealth,  as  some  observers  have  reported.  Apart  alto  gether  from  her  international  debts  leaving  on  one  side  altogether  the  gigantic  payments  of  the  indemnities  which  she  has  undertaken-her  industry  and  com  merce  are  about  two-thirds  normal  com  pared  with  the  pre-war  standard.  Her  imports  of  cotton  amount  to  nearly  half  of  thcse  in  1913.  Her  ioal  output  during  the  first  four  months  of  this  year  was  44,500,000  tons  compared  with  57,000,000  toxas  in  the  same  period  of  1913.  ""Half  the  amount  of  pre-war  tonnage  (largely  under  foreign  flags)  is  now  coming  into  the  port  of  Iamburg.   If  They  Pay!  ""All  this  is  a  sign  of  industrial  and  conmmunercial  recovery,  astoundmg  as  a  proof  of  cnergy,  industry,  and  organised  efficiency,  after  the  shock  of  national  de  feat.  But  those  German  people  who  have  put  up  such  a  tremendous  fight  for  their  old  place  in  the  world  are  now  confronted  with  the  necessity  of  paying  indemnities  to  the  victor  nations  which  will  test  their  power  of  recovery  to  the  uttermost  and  demand  new  and  unpre  cedented  efforts.  It  is  not  going  to  be  easy  for  them  to  pay.  If  they  suc  ceel,  it  will  be  the  greatest  industrial  adventure  ever  undertaken  by  any  people  in  the  world.  To  succeed  they  must  in  crease  their  volume  of  exports  by  at  least  fotir  times,  which  would  be  an  achievement  unrivalled  in  the  industrial  history  of  the  world.  Con  they  do  that.  and  if  they  do  what  will  be  the  effect  upon  other  nations?  ""It  has  already  been  asked  by  Mr.  Reginald  McKenna.  What  will  happen  to  British  trade  if  Germany  pays  her  indemnities  in  the  only  way  possible  by  an  immense  increase  of  exports?  The  very  fulfilment  of  her  pledges  will  ruin  the  countries  receiving  payment  by  the  destruction  of  their  own  export  trade.  .o  we  reach  the  monstrous  para  dox  that  in  shouting  *Make  Germany  pay!'  we  were  insisting  upon  our  own  ruin.  The  only  aure  for  the  present  sickness  of  world  trade  is  to  return  to  normal  canditions  of  imports  balancing  exports,  and  of  a  free  and  natural  flow  of  trade.  ""Condensing  very  briefly  the  results  of  my  visit  to  Berlin,  it  will  be  seen  that  in  my  opinion  Germany  will  make  a  serious  endeavour  to  fulfil  her  pledges,  and  is  in  a  fair  way  (if  she  retains  the  resources  of  ,her  raw  material  in  Upper  Silesia  and  elsewhere)  to  capture  the  industrial  supreieny  of  Europe.""",1921-09-26T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/28003933,"Sir Philip Gibbs gives a remarkable account of the new spirit and the renewal of industry in Germany.

The  Liverpool  ""Corn  Trade  News""  of  June  8,  said:—'""The  salient  feature  ot  the  barley  position  in  2Jorth  America-  >s  the  heaviness  of  receipts  at  Winnipeg.  It;  was,  of  course,  a  foregone  conclusion  that  riio  country  elevator  .stocks  would  ccme'  forward,  freely  as  apon.  as  elevator  I  was  available  at  head  -of  lakes,  and  the  actual  movement  is  certainly  liberal,  the  Canadian  receipts  for  -the  third  week  of.  Hay  totalling  649  carloads,  compared  with  439  at  all  the  chief  United  States  north  western  centres,  including  Chicago.  Hail  advices  from  San  EVanci?co  say  that  the  new  Californian.  crop  is  cot  yet  moving  to  an  appreciable  extent.  In  the  Pacific  north-west  there  has  been  some  drought  damage,  but  a  good  crop  is  still  expected  there,  whilst  in  other  parts  of  the  United  States  and  in  Canada,  prospects  are  favorable,  although  more  rain  is  wanted.  European  crops  arc  doing  weil  in  Russia,  Hungary,  Germany,  and  Great  Britain,  butFrance  complains  of  deterioration  and  Roumania  has  suffered  from  a  very  severe  storm.  North  African  reports  continue  to  speak  favorably  of  the  harvest,  and  a  cable  advice  from  our  Persian  Gulf  cor  respondent  reports  a  surplus  of  400,000  quarters  in  Iraq.  Russian  reports  continue  to  ear  that  good  quantities  arc  coming  forward  from  producing  regions,  and  we  have  no  doubt  that  a  good  part  of  this  barley  will  be  made  available  for  the  ex  port  trade.  DanubUn  supplies,  on  the  other  hand,  are  shrinking.  The  visible  supnly  in  the  United  States  shows  a  small  increase,  being  now  4,061,000  basliets.  compared  with  3.830,003  a  week  ago,  and  2,810,000  a  year  ago.

121943879,GERMAN PRESIDENCY.,"  GERMAN  PRESIDENCY.  The  election  of  Marshal  Von  RLin  dsburg  to  the  German  Prelsidency  will  occasion  a  good  deal  of  misgiving  in  Europe,  and  particularly  In  France,  where  every  action  of  Germany  is  re  garded  with  the  gravest  suspicion.  It  is  hardly  likely,  of  cource,  that  there  will  be  any  immediate  change  of  Gcr.  man  Dolicy.  Even  the  supporters  of  the  now  President,  Jubilant  as  they  must  be,  would  not  dare  to  take  the  jisk  of  provoking  civil  war.  At  the  same  time  the  victory  of  HiIndenburg,  who  is  tihe  figurehead  of  the  Monarchists,  is  sug  gestive  of  the  growing  strength  of  that  element  which  would  turn  thle  military  defeat  of  the  Great  War  Into  a  diplo  matic  success,  or  at  least  a  draw  with  out  penalties.  There  was  a  time  when  the  aged  marshal's  name  was  one  to  conjure  with.,  iHe  was  the  Idol  of  a  deluded  people,  but  when  the  ""im  pregnable""  imne  which  bore  his  name  was  broken,  when  the  Australlans  participated  in  the  smashing  blow  that  crumpled  up  his  armies,  ficktle  fame  deserted  him.  Since  then  he  Ilas  tasted  the  sorrows  as  well  as  the  sweets  of  public  eminence.  A  hero  and  a  butt,  a  national  saviour  and  a  na   tional  scapegoat,  a  great  soldier  to  whom  a  war  fired  people  paid  bound  less  homage,.  and  a  reputed  failure  bowed  down  beneath  popular  derision,  all  these  vagaries  Von  Hindenburg  has  experienced:  and  now  he  has  emerged  from  obsburity  into  triumph.  He  has  becomen  the  leader  of  tile  German  na  tion  with.  power  to  mould  its  progress  to  his  will.  Through  all  the  conflict  of  opinion  that  filters  through  the  calbles  it  is  difficult  to  gauge  with  any  degree  of  accuracy  the  trend  of  th'ought  in  Ger  many.  Tile  statements  the  new  PrCs  dent  has  m'ale  frops  time  to  tintme  have  in  them  the  elements  of  confu  sion;  but  it  seems  reasonably  certain  that  the  nation  as  a  whole  is  by  no  means  irrevocably  coninitted  to'  tile  republican  form  of  government.  Nor  is  there  .any  sound  ground  for  believing  that  .the  nation  Is  prepared  tio  accept  the  consequences  of  the  d~feat  of  her  reckless  bid  for  world  power.  It  has  been  well  sald  thatthere  is  no  sign  of  'disarmament  of  the  intellect  in  Ger  many,""  and  the  Allied  Military  Mis  sion  has  discovered  disturbing  signs  of  purposeful  evasion  of  treaty  obliga  tions.  The  same  spirit  has  been  en  countered  in  other  directions.  The  schemes  of  successive  governments  to  outwit  theAllies  and  hscape  financial  burdens  ruined  tile  countr.y's  .cur  rency'and  shattered  its  credit.  Sonme  months  ago  we  pointed  out  that  *  the  trouble  seems  to  be  the  persistence  of  tile  Prusslan  military  caste,  backed  by  the  war  profiteers  and  imperiallaistic  intellectuals.  German  democracy  is  being  trampled  upon  by  thle  wcr  lords,  and  there  is  little  prospect  of  real  peace  until  the  yoke  of  the  Juinkers  has  been  removed  front  their  necks.  There  is  dome  consolation.  in  the  knowledge  that  the  Republican  vote  is  still  a  force  to  be  reckoned  with  in  tile  constituencieo.  In  tfact  some  of  tihe  election  figures  which  have  just  been  published  suggest  that  there  are  more  Republicans  thaAl  Monarchists.  and  whether  their  preference  for  Dr.  Marx  indicated  a  belief  that  the  Replublican  form  of  gpvernment  was  the  ideal,  or  merely  the  best  expedient  for  mollify  ing  publlec  opinion  in  othler  countries,  tile  result  is  much  thle  same.  Von  -in  denburg  cannot  afford  to  isgnore  that  feeling  entirely.  The  Reiclhstag,.  too,  is  still  committed  to  Republiceanisl.  biut  the  new  President  has  power  to  dce  the  Government  and  the  public  ser  vice  a  pronounced  Monarchist  colour  In  any  cas.e  the  realnt  damange  will  coute  from  anxiety  as  to  what  Hindlenburg  may  do.

The  singing  of  ""O,  Perfect  Love,""  by  St.  Augustine's  Church  of  England  choir,  heralded  the  arrival  of  Miss  Ag-  nes  Freeman  on  Tuesday  evening  last  for  her  marriage  to  Mr.  John  F.  W.  Luckie,  of  Booleroo,  N.S.W.,  and  form-  erly  of  Inverell.  The  bride  is  the  youngest  daughter  of  Mrs.  A.  Free-   man,  of  Inverell,  and  the  late  Mr.  A.  de  M.  Freeman,  and  the  bridegroom  is  the  only  son  of  Mr.  and  Mrs.  W.  Luckie,  of  Mendooran.  Rev.  E.  H.  Stammer  officiated  and  Miss  Patt  pre-  sided  at  the  organ.  A  veil  of  Brussels  lace,  over  a  beau-  tifully  cut  gown  of  silver  tinsel  satin,  was  worn  by  the  bride,  who  looked  radiant  on  entering  the  church,  accompanied  by  her  brother-in-law,  Mr.  E.  Hargrave,  who  subsequently  gave  her  away.  The  bride  carried  a  bouquet  of  blue  lillies  and  cornflowers,  tied  with  silver  streamers.  Miss  Mona  Delbridge  was  bridesmaid   and  wore  a  frock  of  blue  embossed  satin,  which  was  made  with  chiffon  shoulder  drapes  falling  to  the  hemline.  She  wore  a  head-dress  of  blue  tulle,  with  a  coronet  of  cream  roses,  and  carried  a  bouquet  of  cream  roses  tied  with  blue  streamers.  Mr.  A.  D.  Freeman,  brother  of  the  bride,  attended  to  the  duties  of  best  man.  The  church  was  beautifully  decorated  with  roses  and  snapdragons,  and  was  the  artistic  work  of  the  brides  many  girl  friends,  who  also  attended  to  the  decorations  in  the  Masonic  hall,  where  the  reception  was  later  held.  Here  the  color  scheme  was  carried  out  in  blue  and  white,  a  large  horse-shoe  of  white  and  silver  predominating  at  the  back  or  the  bridal  table,  presenting  a  picturesque  setting  for  the  occasion.  Large  bowls  of  sweet-peas,  roses,  and   aquelegias  graced  the  tables,  whilst  the  beautifully-decorated  two-decker  cake  held  pride  of  place.  About  one  hundred  guests  were  re-  ceived  by  Mrs.  Freeman,  who  chose  a  lovely  gown  of  black  velvet  with  black  toque,  and  carried  a  posy  of  Tal-  isman  roses.  Mrs.  E.  Hargrave  as-  sisted,  wearing  a  gown  of  blue  georget-  te.  Harding's  orchestra  was  in  at-  tendance  and  rendered  numbers  ap-  propriate  to  the  occasion,  and  later  when  the  guests  indulged  in  dancing.  When  leaving  for  the  honeymoon,  which  is  being  spent  motoring  on  the  South  Coast,  the  bride  chose  a  smart  tailored  costume,  with  navy  accessor-  ies.  The  young  couple,  whose  future  home   will  be  at  Booleroo,  N.S.W.,  were  the  recipients  of  a  beautiful  array  of  gifts,  which  were  displayed  on  tables  in  the  hall,  and  received  much  favourable  comment  from  the  guests.",1938-10-14T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/185833550,"The [?] Perfect Love,"" by St. [?] of [?] choir [?] arrival of [?]",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article185833550?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1930-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1939-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The Inverell Times (NSW : 1899 - 1907, 1909 - 1954)",150.48727416992188,very relevant

Knrl  Frank,  deputy  leader  of  the  party  and  others,  came  in^conflict-.wlth  ..the  ‘police,  as^  they  were  making  way  for  him  and  other  leaders  to  get  to  their  motor’cars  after  having  addressed’a  political  meeting  that  had  been  for  bidden  by  the  police.  The  incident  followed  the  arrest,  a  few  weeks  earl  ier,  of  another  prominent  member  of  tho'party,  Hans  Rutha,  on  non  political  charges  concerning  public   moralB.   .  The  Sudeten  .  Doutch  comprise  the  majority  of  the  large  Germun  minority  in  Czechoslovakia.  Unlike  the  mod  erate  -  minority  of  Germans,  in  that  country,  the  Sudeten  Doutsch  refuses  to  co'-operato  with  the  Czech  Govern  ment.  •  They  are  Nazi  in  outlook,  and  favour  the  establishment  of  ""MU  tel  Buropa”  under  the  influence  of  the  Tfhird  Reich.  As  an  outcome  of  the  Teplitz-Schonau  incident  their  leader  Konrad  Hcnlein,  in  a  letter  to  Presi  dent  Bones,  has  demanded  “autonomy""  for""  all  Gormans  living  in  Czechoslo  vakia,   The  German  Press  accused  the  Czech  police  of  “serious  excesses,’*  de  claring  that  “Sudetlc  Germun  patience  is  at  an  end.  The  ntmosphere  is  laden-with,  thunder,  and  a  single  spark  might'  be  '  suillclcnt  to,  turn  this  Incident  into  u^ftre  of  revolt.""  V''The  National  Zelturig  of  Bsson  (Gen.  GoerJng's  paper)  declared  that  the  in  cident  was  an  Insult,  to  70,000,000  Germans.   It  turned  again  to  accusing  the   Czech  government  of  conspiracy  with  Soviet  Russia  against  Germany,  de  claring  that  dt  was  under  Russian  ■  patronage  that  the  Czechs  oxerclscd  their  ’barbarous""  rule.  The  Czech  Press,  without  regard  to  political  party,  strongly  condemned  the  activ  ities  of  the  Sudctic  Germans,  and  re  fused  to.  publish  Henloin's  letter  to  President  Benes,  -and  Herr  Henleln’s  paper,  in  which  Ills  letter  appeared,  was  confiscated.   Meanwhile,  Dr.  Mastny,  the  Czech  Ambassador,  made  an  oRlcial  protest  in  Berlin  agaiinst  the  attitude  of  the  German  press,  blit  the  German  Foreign  Minister  rebuffed  ’  the  protest'  as  misplaced.  \r  •  ‘   Tlie  real  significance  of  the  out  break  lies  deeper,  and  is  part  of  a  long-continued  effort  by  Germany  to  get  Czechoslovakia  to  break  off  treaty  connection  with  Soviet  Russia.  Ger  man  press  propaganda  to  this  end  has  continuously  alleged  the  presence  in  Czechoslovakia  of  Russian  aviators  and  military  officers,  and  the  erection  of  Soviet  military  aerodromes  on  Czech  territory,  ns  well  as  the  build  ing  of  a  strategic  railway  which  will  link  Czechoslovakia  directly  to  Russia  through  Roumania.   Behind,  this  again  lies  the  German  dream  ~of  “Mlttel  Buropa,”  In  which  nil  the  German-speaking  people  of  Central  13urope  are  to  be  united  into  one  ’‘Grenter  Germany,”  which  will   dominate  Central  and  'Eastern  Europe:  politically  and  economically.  Ger  many  thus  seeks  a  free  hand  In  East  ern  Europe,  and  feels  she  might  achieve  it  if  she  could  discredit  -Czechoslovakia  In  the  eyes  of  the  Western  .lSuropean  nations,  particu  larly  England.  It  is  significant,  therefore,  that  opinion  in  England  is  already  divided.  Thcrp  arc  thosq  who  would  defend  the  integrity  of  Czecho  slovakia  at  all  costs,.  and  those  who  would  readily  sacrifice  the  Czechs  if  they  thought  they  could  keep  war  from  Western  Europe.   At  the-  same  lime,  another  move  ment  Is  growing  in  Central  Europe  among  the  small  nations  who  fear  tlm  they  might  be  swallowed  up  by  Ger  many.  Relations  between  Czecho  slovakia,  Austria  and  Hungary  are  more  cordial  than  ever  before,  and  might  led  to  something  like  n  defen  sive  alliance.  Germany,  on  the  other  hand,  is  countering  by  economic  pene  tration  of  Yugo-Slavla,  Bulgaria  and   Roumania.",1938-01-28T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/270362338,"The latter half of October 1937 was marked by a revival of bitter antiCzech propaganda in the German Press, The outbreak had as a",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article270362338?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1930-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1939-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,Kyabram Free Press and Rodney and Deakin Shire Advocate (Vic. : 1894 - 1955),140.80377197265625,very relevant

161051821,GERMAN DEBTS.,"  GERMAN  DEBTS.   When  Germany,  a  month  ago,  placed  an  embargo  upon  the  import  of  wool,  amongst  other  raw  materials,  it  was  noted  here  that  this  situation  had  been  arrived  at  as  part  of  a  German  programme  to  bring  pressure  to  bear  upon  her  debtors  in  regard  to  the  payment  of  the  debts  owed  by  that  country  overseas.   For  some  two  years  now  Germany  has  not  been  paying  the  interest  upon  her  debts,  whilst  instalments  of  principal  long  ago  ceased.  A  crisis  has  now  been  reached  with  the  refusal  of  Germany,  through  the  mouth  of  Dr.  Schacht  (president  of  the  Reichsbank),  to  pay  interest  or  any  proportion  of  interest  upon  her  debts,  includ  ing  the  Dawes  and  Young  loans.  This  step  amounts  to  repudiation.  The  requests,  polite  enough  in  all  conscience,  of  the  British  and  French  Governments  for  further  information  on  the  situation,  are  declared  by  the  Nazi  organs  to  be.  'mere  bluff'  and  the  principal  Nazi  newspaper  states  that,  should  England  take  any  active  steps  against  Germany  in  regard  to  these  debts,  Germany  would  'retaliate  against  the  whole  British  Empire  which  sells  considerably  more  to  Germany  than  it  buys  from  her'.  'Whilst  it  may  be  true  that  Germany  buys  more  from  the  British  Empire  than  that  Empire  buys  from  her,  the  thought  might  occur  even  to  the  Nazi  intelligence  that  it  is  no  benefit  to  sell  to  a  country  which  does  not  pay.  It  is  better  to  be  without  the  business.  .  Ever  since  the  AVar  period,  German  national  finance  has  been  a  stumbling  block  to  Europe.  After  the  inflation  period  the  Dawes  loan  was  floated,  for  the  purpose  of  putting  Germany  upon  her  financial  feet  and  restoring  her  currency.  When  the  final  reparation  settlement  was  arrived  at,  the  Young  loan  was  floated  to  assist  in  that  settlement.  Germany  had  the  money  but  reparations  have  been  done  away  with.  At  every  turn  Germany  has  scored,  and  she  proposed  to  crown  her  victories  of  the  past  by  an  open  repudiation  of  her  international  obligations.  It  may  or  it  may  not  be  surprising  that  Nazi  finance  should  in  the  end  come  down  to  the  same  level  as  the  finance  of  the  Bolshevists,  to  whom  the  Nazi  spirit  is  alleged  to  be  so  opposed.  The  affair  may  prove  to  be  a  further  lesson,  and  it  may  be  hoped  a  lesson  which  will  sink  home,  to  those  who  for  so  long  have  argued  that  the  reconstruction  of  world  trade  can  only  be,  or  chiefly  be,  accomplished  by  the  financial  reconstruction  of  Europe.  Hun  dreds  of  millions  of  pounds  have  been  lent  to  the  countries  of  Central  Europe  for  reconstruction  purposes,  with  the  consequence  that,  with  one  exception  (Czechoslovakia),  they  are  all  to-day  as  bankrupt  as  they  ever  were.",1934-05-01T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/161051821,"When Germany, a month ago, placed an embargo upon the import of wool, amongst other raw materials, it was noted here that this situation had been arrived at as part of a German programme to bring pressure to bear upon her",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article161051821?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1930-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1939-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"Daily Commercial News and Shipping List (Sydney, NSW : 1891 - 1954)",135.3385467529297,very relevant

161143323,GERMAN AFFAIRS.,"  GERMAN  AFFAIRS.   On  Sunday  last  a  plebiscite  was  held  in  Germany,  by  which  it  was  supposedly  intended  that  the  people  of  Ger  -  many  should  Have  an  opportunity  of  expressing  their  opinion  of  the  amalgamation  of  the  two  offices  of  President  of  the  Republic  and  Chancellor  in  the  person  of  Adolf  Hitler,  the  Chancellor.   Previous  to  the  plebiscite  an  intensive  campaign  had  been  under  taken  by  microphone,  through  the  press,  by  every  sort  of  emotional  excitement,  to  ensure  that  the  result  of  the  voting  should  be  in  the  affirmative.  Considering  the  circumstances  of  government  in  Germany  to-day,  there  could  never  have  been  much  doubt  upon  this  point,  because  it  is  an  acknowledged  rule  of  Nazidom,  expressed  many  times  by  Herren  Hitler,  Goering  and  Goebbels,  that  there  can  be  no  opposition,  no  other  way  of  thinking  in  Germany  to  that  which  these  gentlemen  dictate.  The  result  of  the  plebiscite  was  in  the  affirmative,  and  it  has  even  been  described  as  a  victorious  result.  Upon  examining  the  figures,  however,  it  is  quite  clear  that  the  Nazi  Government  is  by  no  means  as  popular  as  might  appear  from  the  figures.  About  10  per  cent,  of  the  population  had  the  courage  to  vote  'No,'  whilst  almost  as  many  again  either  spoilt  their  ballot  papers  or  did  not  vote  at  all.  It  is  to  be  assumed  that  those  who  spoilt  their  papers  and  did  not  vote  were  definitely  opposed  to  the  present  regime  but  had  not  got  the  courage  to  say  so.  After  all,  the  present  circumstances  of  Germany  are  particularly  unhappy.  The  country  is  on  the  verge  of  bankruptcy;  the  restric  tions  upon  food,  clothing  and  raw  materials  are  reminiscent  of  war  time  measures:  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  is  deeply  dissatisfied,  and  the  Protestant  Church  not  less  so  ;  the  great  Industrialists  view  with  horror  the  swing  of  Nazi  economic  doctrine  towards  Com  munism  ;  even  in  the  ranks  of  Hitlerdom  there  is  certainly  great  unrest.  Foreign  observers  in  the  country  regard  the  situation  internally  with  considerable  apprehension.  The  events  of  June  30,  when  a  number  of  Storm  Troopers  were  shot  out  of  hand,  when  General  von  Schleicher  and  his  wife  were  assassinated,  and  an  unknown  number  of  persons  disposed  of,  have  left  a  very  sour  impression  in  Germany  as  to  the  future.  The  re  ception  accorded  to  the  Chancellor,  when  he  addressed  the  Reichstag  a  fortnight  after  those  events,  was  cool  in  the  extreme.  The  per  sonal  accounts  of  eye  witnesses  are  now  available  in  Australia,  and  confirm  in  every  detail  and  strengthen  the  observations  which  were  cabled  to  this  country  at  that  time.  The  position  has  been  summed  up  as  representing  the  end  of  Nazism  as  it  has  been  in  the  past,  and  the  beginning  of  its  end  altogether.  The  internal  position  in  Germany  is  of  the  first  importance,  not  only  to  Germany,  but  to  the  rest  of  the  world,  because,  whatever  happens  in  that  country  must  seriously  affect  affairs  in  other  parts  of  the  world,  particularly  the  present  stage  of  economic  recovery.  This  has  been  seen  in  Australia  by  the  fall  in  the  wool  market,  fol  lowing  upon  the  embargo  laid  by  Germany  upon  the  import  of  raw  material.  It  is  the  continued  uncertainty  as  to  what  will  eventuate  in  that  country  which  still  dominates  the  wool  market,  and  indeed,  all  other  markets  for  raw  materials.  It  is  not  until  Germany  becomes  stabilised  under  one  form  of  Government  or  another,  and  until  what  Shakespeare  calls  'the  alarums  and  excursions'  in  that  country  cease,  and  its  unhappy  people  can  settle  down  to  internal  peace  and  internal  development,  that  the  general  situation  can  right  itself.",1934-08-23T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/161143323,"On Sunday last a plebiscite was held in Germany, by which it was supposedly intended that the people of Germany should have an opportunity of expressing their opinion of the amalgamation of the two offices of President",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article161143323?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1930-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1939-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"Daily Commercial News and Shipping List (Sydney, NSW : 1891 - 1954)",135.3385467529297,very relevant

215094470,GERMAN COURTSHIP.,"  GERMAN  COURTSHIP.   Courtship  in  Germany  is  a  very  business-like  affair.  All  the  love-  making  is  done  in  public.  Even  a  hichlv-born  en  traced  counle  walk   about  arm-in-arm  or  hand-in-hand.  They  embrace  in  public,  he  sits  with  his  arm  round  her  waist  at  dinner,  and  everyone  encourages  such  ver-  flowing  evidences  of  affection.  The  German,  however,  who  made  love  so  madly  before  marriage  allows  his  ardour  to  cool  after  a  few  years  of  wedded  life  are  passed.  Army  officers  are  regarded  as  ideal  husbands-for  well-to-do  girls,  but  the  father-in-law  generally  has  to  pay  the  soldier's  debts.  A  youth  may  be  only  a  penniless  lieutenant,  with  nothing  to  recommend  him  but  his  debts  and  his  uniform;  but,  provided  he  comes  of  a  good  family,  he  can  propose  for  any  daughter,  no  matter  how  well-to-  do  or  exalted  a  personage  her  father  'may  be.

22923371,German Defeat.,"  German  Defeat.   THE  former  Crown  Prince  Rupprecht  of  Bavaria,  commander  of  the  German  sixth  army  on  the  Western  Front,  has  recently  published,  in  some-   what  condensed  form,  his  wartime  diary.  Bupprecht  was  a  competent  soldier,  not  a  merely  decorative  army  chief  like  the  Crown  Prince  of  Prussia,  writes  a  Berlin  correspondent.  He  exercised  actual  command,  and  was  re  garded  with  respect  by  the  real  di  rectors  of  German  operations,  the  men  In  control  of  the  General  Staff,  and  the  High  Command.  He  also  possessed  an  independence  of  judgment  which  enabled  him  to  see  the  errors  committed  by  his  superiors  and  to  sense  the  German  military  failure  at  a  time  when  the  highest  military  authorities  were  still  deceiv  ing  the  public  with  predictions  of  vic  ton  and  a  profitable  peace.  An  article  in  the  ""Vossische  Zeitung""  notes  and  comments  on  some  of  the  diary's  more  striking  entries.  It  says:  '""More  than  a  year  ahead  I  saw  coming  everything  that  did  come/  he  wrote  on  November  1,  1018,  to  his  father,  to  whom  during  the  war  he  had  imparted  his  hopes  and  cares  in  a  long  series  of  very  detailed  letters.  He  recognised  the  causes  of  the  break  down—the  declining  strength  of  an  overtaxed  and  decimated  army,  and  the  numerical  superiority  of  the  Allies,  due  to  decisive  American  reinforce  ments.  In  these  frank  letters-to  his  father  there  is  no  talk  of  a  'stab  in  the  back.'  ""On  the  contrary.  The  bow  was  bent  so  far  that  it  finally  broke/  he  wrote  on  September  30.  1918.  Already,  on  June  1.  1918,  when  Ludendorff  stlH  hoped  to  break  through  the  French  front  with  his  offensive,  the  Crown  Prince  advised  peace  in  a  report  to  Chancellor  Hertling:  Now  we  have  trumps  in  our  hand—later  we  -shall  hare  none.'  ""He  was  not  deceived  by  the  initial  successes  of  the  Boissons-Rheinvs  of  fensive  in  July,  1918:  'In  the  horn*  Press  these  last  few  days  the  battle*  near  Rheims  and  Boiasons  are  pictured  as  great  German  successes,  on  the  of  fensive  and  on  the  defensive.  I  iind  such  deception  of  public  opinion  in  excusable/  ""On  September  4  he  saw  thai  only  an  immediate  peace  proposal  could  stave  off  the  catastrophe.  Re  wrote:  'The  general  situation  Is  more  critical  than  ever.  The  battalions  of  the  regi  ments  coming  out  of  battle  often  num  ber  between  40  and  4O?  men.  It  is  also  to  be  feared  that  under  some  cir  cumstances  the  enemy  may  succeed  within  a  few  days  in  breaking  thepugh  our  front.  An  immediate  peace  pro  posal—even  with  great  sacrifices—is  urgently  required/  ""On  September  30  he  saw  that  all  was  lost,  although,  as  he  stated  out,  'every  one  who  expresses  hia  opinion  is  regarded  as  a  slacker  and  pessimist  a  weakling,  and  an  inferior  person/  He  said:  ~  •  .

It  is  urgently  necessary  to  con  clude  peace  at  any  price,  for  we  are  as  good  as  defenceless/  ""  The  Crown  Prlace  also  criticises  both  the  Weimar  and  fee  Bismarckian  con  stitutions  for  giving  too  much  power  to  Prussia.  He  says  on  this  point:  •*With  all  the  North's  services  it  cannot  be  denied  that  under  its  polit  ical  leaderahin  Germany  suffered  the  greatest  political  catastrophe  in  her  history.""",1930-01-02T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/22923371,"THE former Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, commander of the German sixth army on the Western Front, has recently published, in",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22923371?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1930-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1939-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The Queenslander (Brisbane, Qld. : 1866 - 1939)",135.3385467529297,very relevant

251753684,GERMAN BARTER.,"  GERMAN  BARTER.   The  German  barter  system  should  have  a  solid  check  in  the  guarantees  given  to  European  countries  by  England  and  France.  Direct  barter  of  certain  definite  bulk  lines  needed  for  immediate  consumption  in  the  countries  concerned  in  the  interchange  may  prove  practical*  but  the  German  policy  is  loaded  against  the  buyer  of  ^ei'man  goods.  .  •  In  many  instances  where  payment  y  Germany  has  been  by  various  lines,  the  quality,  modernity  and  other  features  of  the  articles  have  been  found  sadly  wanting  and  in  South  America  and  Eastern  Europe,  the  sharp  practices  of  German  exporters  have  led'to  the  cancellation  of  the  agreements.  There  u,  however,  a  more  serious  factor  for  consideration.  In  most  instances  German  purchases  are  of  primary  products.  Having  secured  supplies  of  such  goods  the  German  authorities  instead,  of  taking  the  goods  into  home  consumption,  have  thrown  them  on  to.certain  markets  points,  evidently  with  the  double  object  of  breaking  the  market  standard  and  at  the  same  time  securing  forr  eign  credits.  This  has  been  done  repeatedly  with  butter  purchased  from  neighboring  countries  and  then  resold  to  their  detriment.  It  could  easily  be  the  same  with  wool,  and  in  this  direction  South  African  woolgrowers  are  becoming  nervous  as  to  the  real  merit  of  the  agreement  which  gives  Germany  wool  at  a  world  price,  and  helps  to  destroy  other  purchasers  trading  power  ,by  the  distribution  of  bartered  manufactured  goods  in  which  the  political  aims  of  the  Nazi  authorities  have   jnore  consideration  than  the  welfare  •  ^  concerned  in  production.  The  entry  of  Dictatorism  into  marketing,  a  natural  sequence  to  Govern  ment  interference  in  trade  and  production,  has  had  startling  lessons.  German  manipulation  of  produce  and  other  like  markets  has  been  disastrous,  but  how  much  heavy  fluctuaitons  in  stocks  and  bonds  have  been  due  to  premeditated  war  scares,  will  make  a  pretty  story  of  gangsterism  cn  a  national  scale  when  the  full  hiscriminality  against  suppliers  of  goods  tory  of  the  last  few  years  is  revealed.

30087625,GERMAN DEMOCRACY,"  GERMAN  DEMOCRACY   ANYTHING  like  an'intelligent   criticism  ;  of  the  speech  of  Herr  Hitler  is  impossible  on  a  first  reading,  and  without  some  guidance  of  opinion  from  those;  who  are  more  closely  in  touch  with  conditions.  Just  as  a  first  thought,  we  are  inclined  to  say  that  there  is  much  fuss  and  fury,  and  very  little  of  solid  fact  or  real-  ity.  '  Throughout  the  speech  we  seem  to  hear  the  clashing  of  arms,  but  with  a  mediaeval  flavour,  as  though  some  ancient  chivalry  under  the  stress  of  emotion  were   banging  swords  and  maces  against  shields  for'the  especial  purpose  of  terrifying  their  enemies.  But  the  initial  remarks  regarding  German  democracy  sound  (strangely  in  Australian  ears.  Herr  Hitler  be-  gan  by  declaring  that  Germany  has  a  democratic  constitution,   which  is  responsible  to  the  people  through  a  single  Deputy,  elected  by  the  votes  of  the  people.  This  indi  vidual  is  expected  to.  harmon-  ise  his  actions  with  his  conscience   to  God,  and  his  duty  to  the  people   he  serves.  We  think  that  no  one   in  this  period  of.  experience  will  doubt  the  sincerity  of  Herr  Hitler  nor  the  reality  of  his  belief  in  his  mission.  But  that  very  sincerity  makes  him  the  more  dangerous.  Democracy  as  represented  by  the  consolidation  of  full  power  of.  Government  in  one  man,  with-an  appointed  bureaucracy  to  carry  out  his  orders,  does  not  seem  to  fit  in  with  any  ideas  gathered  either  from  the  past  or  the  pre-  sent.  And!  a  democrat  who  is  an  autocrat,  and  who  while  passion-  ately  declaring  the  futility  of  war,  organises  his  people  on  a  war  basis,  must  be  regarded  as  a  men-  ace.  Perhaps  Herr  Hitler's  de-  finition^  German  democracy  may  stimulate  thoughtful  people  in  other  countries  to  consider  whether,  in  practice,  there  is  such  a  thing.",1935-05-23T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/30087625,"ANYTHING like an intelligent criticism of the speech of Herr Hitler is impossible on a first reading, and without some",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article30087625?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1930-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1939-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The Mercury (Hobart, Tas. : 1860 - 1954)",135.3385467529297,very relevant

52363951,GERMAN MINES,"  GERMAN  MINES  GERMANY'S  RUTHLESS  and  in  discriminate  use  of  mines  is  plainly  intended  to  frighten  all  ship  ping  away  from  Britain.  Since  she  has  no  friends  to  lose  she  has  thrown  all  the  laws  of  warfare  overboard  and  is  prepared  to  sink  the  ships  of  any  nation  in  a  desperate  attempt  to  blockade  Britain  as  she  herself  is  blockaded.  It  is  a  campaign  of  ter  rorism  that  will  serve  only  to  hasten  the  alignment  of  nations  in  active  opposition  to  Germany  in  this  war.  Apart  from  the  way  in  which  the  mines  are  being  used,  the  terrific  explosive  content  of  some  of  them  is  proof  of  Germany's  hope  of  in  timidating  all  shipping  movement  in  English  waters.  The  charges  are  far  stronger  than  necessary  merely  to  sink  a  ship.  The  vessels  that  strike  them  are  blown  almost  to  pieces,  making  heavy  loss  of  civilian  life  in  evitable.  The  sinking  of  the  Japanese  liner,  Terekuni  Maru,  will  cause  great  anger  and  perturbation  in  Japan,  and  may  have  a  profound  effect  upon  Japanese  foreign  policy  at  a  time  when  Nippon's  international  rela  tions  are  in  a  state  of  flux.  It  will  be  useless  for  Germany  to  blame  Mr.  Winston  Churchill  for  the  mining  of  this  vessel.  Surprisingly  enough,  the  Nazis  have  now  admitted  that  their  mines  have  been  responsible  for  the  loss  of  the  neutral  vessels  sunk  dur  ing  the  last  few  days.  ""Germany  re  grets  it  if  the  results  are  rather  sad  for  neutrals,  but  can  do  nothing  about  it,""  said  a  broadcast  from  Hamburg.  Perhaps  she  would  not  have  been  so  frank  had  she  known  that  within  a  few  hours  a  crack  Jap  anese  liner  was  to  be  sent  to  the  bottom  of  the  sea  by  her  agency.  Japan  will  consider  this  disaster  in  conjunction  with  the  report  that  Germany  has  bought  from  Russia  twenty  submarines  for  operations  in  the  Far  East  and  the  Indian  Ocpan.  The  risk  of  total  war  being  extended  by  Germany  to  these  seas  cannot  be  dismissed.  So  far  as  Britain  is  con  cerned,  it  is  extremely  unlikely  that  the  new  German  frightfulness  will  be  successful  in  cutting  her  off  from  the  world  and  starving  her  into  submis  sion.

11075522,German Universities,"  German  Universities   Sir,  -  Would  you  permit  me  to  make  comment  on  Sir  James  Barrett's  letter,  which  appeared  in  Saturday's  magazine  section  under  the  heading  ""German  Uni-  versities.""  The  writer  states  that  2,000  non-Aryans  and  others  have  been  dis-  missed  from'the  German  universities  be-  cause  their  outlook  did  not  commend  Itself  to  the  German  Government,  and  hopes  this  is  due  only  to  a  passing  emotional  phase.  To  this  I  would  like  to  add  that  not  only  the  universities,  but  the  Press,  cinema,  theatre,  musical  world,  publishing  houses,  art  world,  schools,  and  professions  -in  short,  all  spheres  which  are  able  to  influence  human  thought  in  a  large  way  -have  been  relieved  of  the  influence  of  people  who  were  known  to  have  used  their  positions  to  spread  the  communistic  ideol-  ogy  by  methods  that  were  so  ably  exposed  in  a  series  of  articles  in  your  paper  quite  recently.  This  was  done  in  order  that  Ger-  man  culture  would  be  able  to  advance  within  the  framework  and  in  the  direction  laid  down  by  Goethe,  Schiller,  Lessing,  &c.,  whom  Sir  James  Barrett  mentions  so  wistfully.  The  German  Government  holds  that  a  people's  culture  derives  its  direc-  tion  from  its  past,  and  can  only  develop  in  the  direction  laid  down  by  that  past;  and  that  alien  influences  can  only  destroy   it.   -  Yours,  &c,  F.

136698154,German Figures,"  German  Figures  The  figures  for  the  so-called  Ger  man  election  are  surely  astounding.  Allowing  for  the  possibility  that  the  Nazi  appeal  caught  the  imagination  of  the  German  people  to  a  much  greater  extent  than  on  the  occasion  of  the  election  for  the  Roichstag  in  March  last,  it  is  impossible  to  accept  the  suggestion  contained  in  the  figures  that  the  people,  forgetful  of  former  divisions,  have  pooled  their  strength  for  the  purpose  of  supporting  Herr  Hitler  and  his  friends.  The  more  rea  sonable.  view  is  that.  though  the  appeal  to  unity  sounded  emotional  depths  to  a  greater  extent  than  for  merly,  fear  operated  to  prevent  a  true  expression  of  opinion.  For  the  Nazis  are  known  In  their  own  country  as  the  upholders  of  force.  and  of  any  method  to  secure  what  they  regard  as  the  welfare  of  the  State.  Taking  the  referendum.  the  question  was-""Do  ""you,  German  man,  and  you,  German  ""woman,  approve  of  the  policy  of  your  ""Government?  Are  you  ready  to  ye  ""cognise  it  as  the  expression  of  your  ""own  views,  and  will  you  solemnly  ""pledge  yourself  to  it?""  The  question  is  important  in  considering  the  figures,  for  only  2.055,000  voted  in  the  nega  tive  compared  with  43,464,000  in  the  affirmative.  If  the  vote  is  a  true  reflex  of  opinion,  the  world  is  told  that  7.000,000  Social  Democrats  and  4.000,000  Communists  who  were  against  the  Nazis  last  March  have  been.  converted  by  a  brutal  terrorism  into  enthusiastic  admiration  for  the  Nazi  regime.  The  relatives  and  friends  of  thousands  of  men  who  have  become  outcasts.  and  thousands  of  others  who  have  been  thrown  into  concentration  camps,  are  so  grateful  to  the  Government  that  they  went  en  thuslastically  to  the  polls  to  testify  their  opinions.  It  is  certainly  difficult  to  believe.  However.  Hitler  has  secur  ed  his  triumph.

193606295,GERMAN CREDITS.,"  GERMAN  CREDITS.   Sir,  —  Under  date  of  12/2/37,  writing  from  Hobart,  Tasmania,  and  duly  pub  lished  in  the  ""Daily  Examiner,""  Mr.  William  Ager  states.—  It  is  reported  that  Germany  has  a  rlpht.  nf  £90(100  000  nf  loan  at  short  call.   mostly  on  England,  and  .which  she  states  she  is  unable  to  pay.  It  is  also-  rumored  that  efforts  are  being  made  to  make  the  United  States  receptive  towards  another  loan  to  Ger  many,  such  loan  to  be  made  jointly  by  British,  French,  and  United  States  in  terests.  It  must  be  clearly,  understood  that  when  a  nation  secures  a  loan  from  another  nation  no  money  is  inter  changed.  Goods  or  materials  are  taken  to  the  amount  of  the  credits  extended.  :  Since  1918  credits  have  been  extend  ed  to  Germany  through  the  control  re  serve  franking  system  in  America  and  England,  and  Germany  as  a  conse  quence  has  become  so  completely  or  ganised  in  air,  field  and  naval  arma  ments  that  she  is  able  to  ignore  the  League  of  Nations,  defy  the  world  and  .hop  over  and  win  unopposed  conquests,  and  the  prevaricating,  subtle,  under  mining  diplomacy  stills  prevails  to  draw  further  goods  and  materials  to  the  strorighold.  Blatantly  denying  the  responsibility  for  the  last  war,  she  may  yet  blame  Britain  for  the  next  be  cause  the  world  is  not  willing  to  hand  over  mandated  territories  upon  demand.  It  must  be  clearly  ,  understood  that  the  world  is  not  dealing  with  German  people,  who  are  a  very  fine  race.  A  gang  of  fiends  who  are  organising  world  wide  mass  murder,  hide  behind  all  this  vast  camouflage  and  the  German  people  are  .  hungry  because  their  resources,  energy  and  hundreds  of  millions  Of  pounds  of  their  wealth  are  absorbed  annually  in  the  maintenance  and  fur  ther  development  of  the  mighty  war  organisation.  The  bluff  about  being  unable  to  pay  has  continued  all  too  long.  The  people  of  the  world  in  general,  and  Great  Bri  tain  in  particular,  should  rub  their  sleepy  eyes  and  realise  what  is  hap  pening  by  the  international  money  sys  tem  controlling  and  extending  credits.  When  Great  Britain  needs  armaments  for  defence,  made  necessary  by  such  gigantic  and,  advanced  preparations  in  Germany,  she  is  told  by  the  same  inter  national  money  monopoly  that  she  must  provide  her  defences  from  taxation.  It  is  to  be  regretted  that  there  is  an  absence  of  such  writers  on  national  and  international  affairs.  In  substantiation  of  Mr.  Ager's  con  tribution,  I  quote  a  broadcast  speeclFby  Dr.  Goddard  on  Sunday  night,  February  14,  on  international  affairs  from  2BL  recorded  in  ""The  Book  of  Time.""  Per  chance  many  listeners  are  aware  that  Dr.  Goddard  is  an  authority  on  inter  national  affairs.  He  said:  Germany  in  her  race  for  armaments  is  depriving  every  individual  population  of  £160  of  food  yearly.  -From  time  to  time  the  cables  flash  across  the  world  some  startling  arith  metic,  but  unfortunately  the  country  press  only  receives  a  brevis  .  account  -in  a  condensed  or  mutilated  'form.  Since   1914  to  1927  it  has  been  my  hobby  to  devote  my  leisure  to  national  and  in  ternational  affairs  published  monthly  in  the  magazine  ""Life.""  Some  newspaper  writers,  -of  course,  if  only  by  force,  of  habit,  reflect  and  exaggerate  the  mood  ;  of  the  moment,  and  they  change  with  the  mood.  They  are  not  so  closely  in  touch  with  actual  facts.  .DISTRACTED  GERMANY.  Germany,  to  the  hasty  observer,  might  well  seem  to  be  on  the  point  of  bank  ruptcy.  In  1923  Sir  Phillip  Gibbs,  thei  noted  war  correspondent,  visited  .  Ger-  1  many,  and  gave  a  graphic  story  of  what:  he  saw  there.  He  said,  however,  that  with  the  mark  at  5uo,000,000  to  the  Eng  lish  pound  note  there  was  still  no  out  ward  sign  of  poverty  or  rum  in  Ger  many.""  He  could  not  make  head  or  cail  of  this  wild  melodrama  of  paper  money  which,  fell  .In  value  by  tens:,  of  millions  between  the  ""soup  and  the  xoffee  of  his  midday  meal.  It  seemed  to  make  ""no  difference  ""  tOtKe  people.  They  still  thronged  the  restaurants  and  cabarets  and  though  .prices  rose.  auto  matically  as  the  exchange  falls,  thev  .eemed  to  get  enough  of  this  f\ntastic  currency  to  pay  f  0  c.  their  pleasure  as  well  as  their  necessity.  ""But,""  he  added,  ""this  is  the  way  in  which  mod  ern  civilisation  '  masks  for  a  time  the  decay  and  the  disease  which  are  eating  at  its  vitals  like  a  spreading  cancer.""  Even  to  the  cool  Australian  mind  looking  across  the  sea  at  the  distrac  tions  and  tumult  of  what  we  call  ""Ger  many,""  it  seems  .that.it  offers  a  spec  tacle  of  ruin  such  as  Europe  has  not  seen  since  the  Forty  Years'  ""Vvar.  Yet  the  ruin  is  not  brought  on  Germany  by   the  sword  of  its  enemies,  but  by  the  insane  policy  of  its  own  rulers.  They  were  too  proud  to  accept  defeat,  and  have  tried  to  evade;  its  just  conse  quences.  The  German  currency  has  been  deliberately  ruined—  and  ruined  on  a  scale  unknown;.in  history—  as  part  of  the  plan  to  make  the  payment  of  the  reparations  for  the  wrongs  done  to  the  nations  it  attacked.  We  have  but  to  contrast  how  Germany  treated  France  in  1870.  For  six  months'  war  she  exacted  a  fine  of  £200,000,000  —  and  Alsace-Lorraine!  And  her  troops  were  quartered  on  France  -till  this  penalty  was  paid.  .Or  we  have  but  to  contrast  the  policy  since  defeat  adopted  by  Austria  with  that  of  Germany  to  realise  that  Germany  has.  brought'  upon  itself  the  suffering  which  now  almost  theatens  it  with  destruction.  Austria  accepted  its  defeat,  and  has  honestly  paid,  as  far  as  possible  the  price  of  defeat!  As  a  result,  it  has  the  sympathy  and  help  of  Europe,  and  is  back  towards  prosper  ity.  It  is  cruel,  perhaps,  to  say  that  '  Germany  has  tried  to  cheat  its  creditors,  but  has  it  honestly  tried'  to  pay  them?  THE  DANCE  OF  THE  GERMAN  MARK.  Only  a  mathematician  accustomed  to  deal  with  what-  may  be  called  astrono  mical  magnitudes  can  keep  touch  with  the  performances  of  the  German  mark;  but  a  record  of  its  gyrations  during,  say,  a  single  fortnight,  may  be  attempt  ed.  The  week  before  the  issue  of  the  Baldwin-Curzon  note,  the  German  mark  was  rated  at  4,000,000  to  the  dollar,  a'rid  under  the  influence  of  the  British  letter   it  went  up  a  few  points  and  reached  2.500,000  to  the  dollar.  Then  came  the  blast  of  Poincai-e's  reply,  with  its  twin  document  from  Brussels,  and  the  mark  tumbled  down  with  meteoric  speed  till  it  touched  about  7,000,000;:  and  then  8,000,000  to  the  dollar.  On.:  September  5,  1923,  it  had  gone  almost  completely  out  of  sight,  as  it  descended  to  20,000,000  to  the  dollar,  and  continued  its  downward  flight  till  it  actually  reached  44,000,000  to  the  dollar.  The  mark,  it  must  be  remembered,  .before  the  Great  War,  was  equal  in  I  value  to  the  British  shilling;  at  the  point  reached  it  was  equal  to  a  forty-  millionth  part  of  a  dollar,  a  value  which  only  a  microscope  of  the  highest  magni  fying  power  could  do  so  much  as  see.  It  was  expected  then  to  fall  tc  100,  LOU,  000  to  the  dollar"",  which  is  about  zero,  and  at  that  stage  ""not  only  cities,  towns  and  Villages,  but  State  railways,  banks,  manufacturing  co-operations,  business  houses  and  even  .  individuals  have  been  printing  and  issuing  their  own  flat  money  during  tnc  I  shortage.""  Now,  how  can  civilised  existence  continue  under  such  con  ditions?  And  since  then  the  mark  has  fallen  to  yet  lower  depths!—  I  am,  etc.,   PETER  KNIGHT.  -",1937-06-18T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/193606295,"Sir,--Under date of 12237, writing from Hobart, Tasmania, and duly published in the ""Daily Examiner,"" Mr. William Ager states.--",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article193606295?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1930-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1939-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"Daily Examiner (Grafton, NSW : 1915 - 1954)",135.32171630859375,very relevant

24699236,GERMAN DEMANDS,"  GERMAN  DEMANDS   HISTORIANS  in  years  yet.  to|   come,  when  they  will  be  in  a  position  to  look  back,  and  make  a  fair-  ly  unbiassed  review  of  the  War,  and  its  consequences,  may  conclude  that  the  Treaty  of  Versailles  can  rank  with  the  Treaty  of  Vienna  a  century  earlier,  as  indicating  a  total  absence  of  under-  standing.  No  doubt  a  great  part  of  the  muddle  was  due  to  the  insistence  of  President  Wilson  that  the  adjust-  ment  of  conditions  must  be  delayed  until  his  own  special,  fad  was  dealt  with.  Certainly  that  insistence  was  responsible  for  the  hasty  creation  of  the  League  of  Nations,  but  since  America  at  once  repudiated  the  under-  takings  of  her  President,  nothing  was  gained.  The  history  of  the  world  since  has  been  a  sad  one.  Some  of  the  clauses  of  the  Treaty  of  Versailles  have  been  ignored,  and  the  financial  clauses  of  this  and  other  treaties  have  been  changed,  and  changed  again,  un-  til  they  are  unrecognisable.  And  now  Germany  is  in  a  condition  of  practical  revolt  against  the  conditions  of  the  Treaty  limiting  her  right  to  arma-  ments.  For  this  spirit,  we  arc  sorry  to  say,  France  has  some  responsibility.  In  spite  of  the  fact  that  Germany  has  been  left  practically  helpless  for  ag-  gression,  France  refuses  every  sugges-  tion  for  a  substantial  reduction  of  armaments.  Perhaps  this  consistent  refusal,  and  the  examples  of  chauvin-  ism,  are  more  directed  against  Italy,  but,  in  order  to  avoid  complications,  Germany  is  held  up  as  the  potential  enemy.  There  has  been  much  adverse  comment  as  to  the  failure  of  Great  Britain,  through  the  League  of  Na-  tions,  or  otherwise,  to  bring  about  a  settlement.  This  criticism  is  not  just.  Great  Britain  has,  during  and  since  the  War,  pulled  so  many  chestnuts  out  of  the  fire  for  others,  all  of  whom  were  ungrateful,  thal  suggestions  of  further  burning  of  fingers  in  the  cause  of  al-  truism  are  not  welcomed.

This  means  a  serious  interruption  to  an  old  established  trade.  But  the  manufac-  turers  are  faced  with  a  difficult  posi-  tion.  Already  there  is  a  great  deal  of  money  owing  for  goods  supplied,  and  the  German  Government  has  not  only  authorised  but  has  practically  com-  pelled  repudiation  of  the  debts.  It  must  be  noted  that  this  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  public  debt,  whether  owed  to  Governments  or  to  private  in-  dividuals  or  companies.  It  is  purely  a  matter  of  private  obligations  incurred  as  between  trading  concerns.  German  merchants  have  bought,  at  prices  fixed  by  mutual  consent,  quantities  of  cotton  goods  from  manufacturers  in  Lanca-  shire,  who  have  paid  for  the  raw  ma-  terial,  the  wages  of  the  persons  em-  ployed,  and  other  incidental  charges  Their  customers  are  men  with  whom   they  have  had  dealings  for  many  years,  j  and  there  has  not  been  any  suggestion  of  doubt  as  to  their  ability  and  willing-  ness  to  meet  their  obligations.  Now  these  are  set  on  one  side,  and  it  has  not  been  possible  even  lo  secure  the  pro-  mise  of  an  arrangement  for  future  payment.  In  the  circumstances  there  can  be  no  other  course  than  to  refuse  further  business.  But  the  position  is  extremely  serious.

251676616,GERMAN SHEEP.,"  GERMAN  SHEEP.   Germany's  flocks  of  sheep  have  been  increased  by  a  third  in  the  past  three  years  in  the  great  drive  for  economic  self-sufficiency.  An  official  census  shows  that  Germany  now  has  4,400,000  sheep,  which  is  1,100,000  more  than  at  the  time  of  the  1932  census.

How  far  Germany  has  progressed  along  the  road  to  general  self-sufficiency  has  been  shown  by  recent  official  figures,  which  showed  that  the  value  of  food  imports  had  declined  from  3,900,000,000  marks  (£325,000,000)  in  1929  to  1,100,000,000  marks  (£91,700,-  1  000)  in  1934.

Coincidental  with  this  pessimistic  outburst  from  a  statesman  who  is  the  very  antithesis  of  a  militarist  or  alarmist,  interesting  information  has  been  published  concerning  the  actual  significance  of  the  state  ment  made  by  the  German  Presi  dent-Chancellor  (Herr  Hitler)  to  the  British  Foreign  Secretary  (Sir  John  Simon)  during  the  Berlin  conversa  tions  recently,  that  Germany  had  already  achieved  air  parity  with  Britain.  This  was  perhaps  gener  ally  assumed  to  mean  that  the  Ger  man  establishment  of  military  air  craft  was  equal  to  that  maintained  in  the  British  Isles-a  total  of  about  480  machines,  but  it  is  now  statged  on  apparently  relialle  authority  that'  Germ?rny's  strength  in  the  air  is  equivalent  to  that  of  the  British  Empire,  or  a  total  of  about  1020  first-line  'planes,  thus  placing  Britain  herself  in  an  in  feriority  of  more  than  two  to  oe.  During  the  Great  War  Germany  was  the  initiator  and  principal  ex  nonent  of  the  policy  of  air  fright  fulness  against  the  civilian  popula  tions  of  the  countries  of  her  enemies,  and  even  after  nearly  twenty  years  there  are  still  a  sufficient  number  of  Britons.  particularly  Londoners,  alive,  who  well  renimember  the  Ger  man  air  raids,  when  bombls  were  dronpnd  ruthlessly  on  the  great  metropolis,  with  no  distinction  be  tween  strictly  military  and  ourely  nonr-military  obiectives,  for  the  dis  b.losuire  of  Germany's  preient   superiority  to  produce  an  irrestist  able  demand  for  muc'h  greater  ac  :eleratiou  of  Britain's  aerial  arman  rnment  than  was  provided  for  in  the  recently  passed  Estimates.  The  German  demand  for  a  navy  ,:iuivalent  to  that  of  France,  or  approximately  one-third  the  size  of  the  British  Navy,  will  also  be  very  hard  for  Britain  to  accept,  for  in  addition  to  the  fact  that  as  the  whole  of  Germany's  war-time  naval  strength  was  surrendered  at  the  close  of  the  war  and  then  scuttled  at  Scapa  Flow,  thus  ensuring  that  any  new  German  navy  will  consist  entirely  of  the  most  modern  ships,  whereas  most  of  the  units  of  the  British  Navy  date  from  war  or  pre  war  years.  Britain's  naval  craft  are  so  distributed  over  the  seven  seas  that  the  force  sought  by  Ger  many  would  approximately  give  her  Iarity  with  Britain  in  the  North  Sea.  As  Germany  has  no  colonies,  and  a  comparatively  short  coast  line,  it  is  difficult  to  see  that  she  has  any  legitimate  claim  to  a  navy  as  big  as  that  of  France  with  her  extended  coastline  on  two  oceans  and  her  somewhat  spread-eagled  African  colonies.  When  Britain's  sufferings  at  the  hands  of  German  aircraft  and  sub  marines  during  the  Great  War  are  rmemembered,  it  will  not  be  surpris  ing,  in  view  of  these  disquieting  trends  of  German  rearmament,  if  the  Prime  Minister's  declaration  about  Germany  having  ""broken  the  road  to  peace""  meats  with  a  re  sponse  from  the  British  public  which  will  materially  stiffen  Britain's  attitude  towards  Europe's  pressing  security  problem.  Germany  appears  to  have  a  strong  case  for  a  substan  tial  measure  of  rearmnament,  but  failing  an  early  and  authoritative  secaling  down  of  her  present  demands  in  that  direction,  she  will  have  her-'  self  to  blame  if  she  finds  practically  her.

37071201,GERMAN DIPLOMACY,"  GERMAN  DIPLOMACY   Sir,  —  In  his  letter  on  the  causes  of  the  Great  War  Mr.  Jones  has  made  many  inaccurate  statements.  He  said,  for  instance,  that  the  Kaiser  aban   doned  the  policy  of  Bismark,  which  stood  for  European  concentration,  friendly  alliance,  and  prevention  by  diplomacy  of  alliances  between  other  countries.  On  the  contrary,  ihe  Bis  markian  policy  was  one  of  deliberate  and  ruthless  conquest.  His  famous  de  claration  was  that  the  destinies  of  Germany  were  to  be  worked  out  not  by  notes  and  speeches,  but  by  blood  and  iron.  His  three  successful  wars  in  six  years  earned  for  him  the  name  of  'The  Iron  Chancellor.'  Mr.  Jones  says  that  during  the  Spanish-American  war,  the  Kaiser  ap  proached  England  with  regard  to  op  posing  the  United  States,  and  that  England  stood  by  America.  But  Mr.  Usher,  in  his  book,  asserts  that  the  Spanish-American  war  was  instigated  by  England  in  order  to  prevent  Ger  many  from  acquiring  the  Spanish  colonies.  Both  statements  may  be  wrong.  Again,  Mr.  Jones  says  that  during  the  Boer  War,  Germany  made  over  tures  to  France  and  Russia,  suggest  ing  combined  action  against  England,  but  that  they  refused.  According  lo  historians  Russia  and  France  were  pre  pared  to  intervene  on  behalf  of  the  Boer  Republic  if  Germany  would  join,  but  she  refused  to  do  so.  In  1899  the  London  'Daily  Mail'  was  full  of  praise  of  Germany.  The  Kaiser  was  hailed  as  'a  '  friend  in  need,  and  a  gallant  gentleman  whose  word  is  bet  ter  than  many  another's  bond.1',  Mr.  Jones  refers  to  General  Bern  hardi's  book  as  proof  of  Germany's  guilt,  A  book,  exactly  parallel  to  General  Bernhardi's,  entitled  'L'Of-   fensive  Contre  Allemagne'  has  been  written  in  France  by  Colonel  Boucher.  Another  correspondent,  Mr.  Watson,  mentioned  the  Agadir  incident,  m  1911  French  and  Spanish  troops  had  all  leir  spheres  marked  out  for  them  by  '  the  secret  articles  in  the  Anglo-French  agreement.  France  took  the  lead  in  threatening  war.  Germany  sent  'The  Panther'  to  Agadir  as  a  protest.  Why  Mr.  Watson  should  see  in  the  building  of  the  Constantinople  —  Bagdad  railway  more  evidence  of  ihe  German  qloven  loof  when  the  whole  world  is  hunt  ing  for  railway  concessions  is  beyond  my  comprehension.—  I  am,  sir,  &c,  Morningside.  -  F.

German  fairy  tales  are  full  of  obsolete  words  and  archaic  constructions  that  may  be  attractive  for  the  educated  German  reader,  but  are  difficult  for  even  well-advanced  students.  Moreover,  German  style  has  changed  greatly  since  the  time  of  the  Brothers  Grimm.

263079241,GERMAN JEWS AND GERMAN CULTURE,"  GERMAN  JEWS  AND   GERMAN  CULTURE   By  ARNO  WITTEN   The  Jews  ai’e  endowed  with  sur  prising  spiritual  gifts.  There  is  one  domain  of  their  own,  the  pro  vince  of  religious  and  moral  ethics  where  the  great  deeds  of  this  small  people  have  shaped  the  human  history  of  millenniums.  The  spreading  of  the  idea  of  the  one,  spiritual  and  •  invisible  God,  the  creation  of  the  Bible,  the  mo  rals  and  teachings  of  Moses,  Christ,  Spinoza  and  Marx  have  in  fluenced  mankind  more  than  the  art  of  the  Egyptians,  the  geogra  phical  explorings  of  the#  Vikings,  the  laws  of  the  Romans,’the  war  deeds  of  Alexander  or  of  Ghengis   Khan.   Although  a  people  that  has  formed  the  shape  and  idea  of  human  life  throughout  the  civili  sed  world  has  certainly  fulfilled  ■the  task  which  history  has  laid  •  on  it  the  Jews  have  over  that  pro  •duced  miracles  also  in  the  sphere  •  of  general  human  culture.  And  .specially  so  in  Germany,  the  coun  try  that  to-day  denies  them  every  valuable  quality  of  mind  and  soul.   Their  contributions  to  art  and  .science  are  almost  inconceivable.  The  more  so  if  we  consider  that   they  have  been  kept  away  from  any  collaboration  with,  and  even  from  the  admission  to,  almost  any  form  of  cultural  life  since  ,  time   immemorial.  No  one  would  expect  people  who  had  been  forced  to  live  in  open  country  and  to  whom  the  doors  have  suddenly  been  opened  to  rush  into  the  building,  to  pull  down  immediately  the  old  walls  and  to  erect  better  ones.  They  must  first  find  out  their  way  in  the  new  surroundings  and  to  accomodate  themselves.  (It  is  •only  a  little  more  than  a  centi.ry  •since  the  Jews  have  been  permit  ted  to  join  the  European  life  with  equal  rights—and  that  indeed  only  formally,  not  even  practic  ally—-and  this  permission  has  al  ready  been  revoked  again,  It  is  instructive  to  remember  that  cruel  fact.  We  sometimes  forget  it).   Besides  that,  there  is  another  reason  why  all  those  achievements  must  be  classified  in  the  highest  ranks  of  human  successes.  For  also  after  their  admission  to  the  European  dinner-table'  they  were  not  served  the  same  dishes.  as  their  fellow-beings.  If  the  Jews  made  the  most  valuable  •  contribu  tions  to  the  welfare  of  the  civi  lised  society  it  was  not  certain  at  all  that  the  .  contributions  were  appreciated  as  they  infallibly  would  have  been  with  their  fellow  scientists  and  fellow-artists.  If  the  Jews  received  any.  rewards  of  their  endeavours  at  all  then  there  was  almost  always  connected  with  it  some  humiliatins.  Although  they  may  have  been  winners  of  the  Nobel-prize  or  they  may  have  gained  the  admiration  of  the  whole  civilised  world,'  as  for  in  stance  Einstein,  who  changed  the  human  outlook  on  eternity,  or  Freud  who  opened  new  perspec  tives  of  men’s  cognition,  they  were  not  regarded  as  digniifed  enough  to  become  ordinary  tea  chers  at  the  university.   But  in  spite  of  those  handicaps,  which  proved  only  that  anti-Jew  ish  feelings  never  had  practically  ceased  to  exist,  the  Jewish  fight  ers  for  the  development  of  man  kind  gave  the  best  of  their  hearts  for  the  benefit  of  the  human  so  ciety,  imbued  with  the  ardent  de  sire  to  further  the  progress  of  the  human  race.  And  it  Is  almost  in  credible  how  marvellously  they  succeeded  in  nearly  every  cultural  province.   At  first  thought  it  may  seem  not  worth  the  while  to  remember  what  the  Jews  have  achieved  in  Germany  and  for  Germany.  In  deed  the  wheels  of  history  will  not  be  turned  into  any  other  direction  by  the  statement  how  much  the  Jews  have  added  to  the  benefit  of  German  name  and  German  fame.  But  it  will  buttress  the  proud  and  the  certain  feeling  of  the  Jews  themselves  that  one  day  when  the  waves  of  hatred  will  have  been  .  calmed  down  Jewish  accomplishments  will  be  recognis  ed  again  and  that  the  world  will  give  the  Jews  that  place,  in  the  council  of  peoples  for  which  they   .  are  entitled  to  claim.   When  the  Jews  in  the  beginning  of  the  19th  century  were—ac  least  formally—admitted  as  equal  to  the  community  of  free  men  in  Germany,  it  was  as  if  a  bulwark  had  been  broken  down  and  the  water  dammed  up  behind  it  had  fallen  like  a  torrent  into  the  open  land.  So  powerful  was  the  mental  energy  that  became  free  and  ru  shed  down  into  every  district  of  spiritual  activity.  Impossible  to  count  down  every  Jew  who  has  added  stones  to  the  edifice  of  Ger  man  art  and  science.  We  can  give  only  a  few  names  out  of  thou  sands.  But  we  can  appraise  the  real  significance  of  that  powerful,  stream  of  spii’itual  fructification  only  if  we  consider  that  the  Jews  comprising  but  1  per  cent  of  the  German  population  at  once  took  part  in  the  building  up  of  the  cul  tural  life  by  contributors  out  numbering  10  or  even  20  times  their  actual  proportion  of  the  po  pulation.  An  example  may  make  it  clear  how  this  miraculous  fact  turned  out  to  be  of  almost  in  credible  .  effects:  The  Jews  for  in  stance  brought  forth  9  remarkable  composers  in  a  little  more  than  one  century;  the  Germans,  in  or  der  to  keep  pace  should  have  had  to  muster  900  (!)  equivalent  ta  lents  or  take  another  example:  About  25  per  cent  of  the  German  Nobel-prize  winners  were  Jews,  equal  to  five  .times  more  than  their  proportion.  And  so  it/-  was  in  nearly  every  district  of  cultural   life.   At  the  beginning  of  that  “Pe-  ,  riod  of  Enlightenment”,  stands  the  venerable  figure  of  the  poor  hunch  backed  office  clerk  and  great  philosopher  Moses  Mendelssohn,  the  friend  of  Lessing.  He  was  still  deep-rooted  in  Jewish  feelings  and  it  was  but  in  his  adult  years  that   he  learnt  to  write  German.  Pro  found  was  his  influence  on  Ger  man  philosophy.  (The  fate  of  his  children  is  significant;  it  shows  how  quickly  by  the  way  of  assi  milation  large  and  valuable  parts  of  Jewry  have  been  absorbed  by  the  German  people:  Two  of  his  sons,  baptized,  became  the  found  ers’  of  one  of  most  famous  Euro  pean  Banks.  His  daughter,  also  baptised,  was  renowned  for  her  literary  salon  and  played  an  im  portant  part  in  the  history  of  Ger  man  literature.  His  grandson  Felix  Mendelssohn-Bartholdy,  baptised,  was  one  of  the  greatest  German  composers.  And  many  of  his  des  cendents  are  reputed  as  artists  and  scientists).  Besides  Mendel  ssohn  there  were  many  more  Jew  ish  philosophers  as  for  instance  Salomon  Maimon,  Otto  Liebmann,  Herman  Cohen,  Gustav  ^  Simmel,  Gustav  Landauer  etc.  Although,  they  were  not  the  great  lonely  stars  they  influenced  largely  thoughts  and  ideas  in  Germany.   In  the  discipline  of  Physics,  Mathematics  and  Physics  near  to  the  province  of  Philosophy,  scores  of  Jews  excelled.  The  one  Einstein  would  suffice  to  procure  the  Jews  a  place  of  honour  in  the  history  of  Science.  Only  the  coming  cen  turies  can  judge  fully  his  import  ance.  But  he  seems  to  be  a  genius  the  like  of  whom  mankind  pro  duces  only  every  some  centuries  to  be  placed  in  line  with  men  like  Ptolemy,  Galileo,  Giordano  Bruno  and  Newton.  And  there  are  many  others  whose  names  can  keep  the  field  also  besides  Einstein.  Hertz  (theory  .  of  electric  waves),  J.  Frank  (theory  of  atoms),  David  sohn  (electro  motor),  Marcus  (petrol  motor),  Berliner  (micro  phone),  Haber  (nitrogen),  Frank  (Kali),  Caro  (dyes),  Willstaetter  (Chlorophyl),  Bayer,  the  son  of  a  Jewish  mother  and  the  founder  of  the'  mighty  German  Dye  concern  (indigo)  and  practically  thou  sands  of  famous  names  more.   Jews  have  always  been  prepon  derant  physicians  and  that  may  partly  explain  the  fact  that  there  was  nearly  no  inventive  medical  achievement  without  Jewish  guid   ance  or  at  least  Jewish  assistance.   It  is  almost  impossible  an  under  taking  to  enumerate  the  names  of  the  countless  medical  pioneers  and  only  a  few  ones  may  therefore  be  mentioned  who  acquired  wide  pub  lic  fame.  So  Meyerhof  (transfor   mation  of  energy),  Zunz  (physio  logy),  Ehrlich  (Salvarsan),  Was  sermann  and  Morgenroth  (both  diagnosis  of  syphilis,  Freud  (psychoanalysis),  Adler  (indivi  dual  psychology),  Minkowsky  (diabetes),  Boas  (stomach  di  seases),  Zondeck  (internal  di  seases),  Asehheim  (pregnancy  diagnosis)  etc.   ,  But  how  much  soever  all  these  contributions  have  added  to  the  famous  reputation  of  German  cul  ture  the  public  in  general  knew  and  appreciated  better  the  Jews,  who  worked  in  the  sphere  of  the  arts.   In  the  first  line  it  was  the  Jew  ish  musicians  who,  even  in  the   land  of  music  proper”  attracted   the  eyes  or  rather  the  ears  of  their  contemporaries.  There  •  are  the  composers  Mendelssohn,  Mey  ei’beer,  Offenbach,  Moscheles,  Ru  binstein,  Joachim,  Mahler,  Schoen  berg,  Korngold,  there  are  the  con  ducted  Walter,  Klemperer,  Klei  ber,  there  are  the  countless  prac  titioning  musicians'  of  world-wide  fame  like  Schnabel,  Horowitz,  Ser  kin,  Hubermann,  Kreisler,  Morini,  Tauber  and  scores  of  them  more.   In  the  art  of  painting  it  was  Liebermann,  Israels,  Lesser  Ury,  Chagall,  Feinger,  Marees  (a  half  Jew)  etc.  who  helped  to  develop  German  artistic  reputation.  That  seems  to  be  indeed  a  very  surpris  ing  fact.  For  since  the  Jews,  pre   (Continued  on  page  6)   GERMAN  JEWS  AND  GERMAN  CULTURE   (Continued  from  page  4)   vented  by  religious  prohibitions,  had  never  excelled  in  the  field  of  painting  it  was  all  the  more  mir  aculous  that  they  could  hold  their  own  without  any  existing  artistic   tradition.   Always  have  the  Jews  been  bear  ers  of  a  deep  inner  conscience  and  masters  of  the  word.  Since  the  days  of  the  Prophets  they  have  been  the  proclaimed  and  propa  gators  of  teachings,  doctrines  and  convictions.  That  may  be  the  ex  planation  of  the  immense  part  played  by  Jews  in  the  German  literature.  The  way  leading  from  Heinrich  Heine  to  Stephan  Zweig  is  short  in  time  but  overcrowded  by  writing,  composing,  teaching  and  admonishing  Jews:  Boeme  and  Weininger,  Wassermann  and  Werfel,  Kaffka  and  Heimann,  Schnitzler  and  Hofmannsthal,  Bu  ber  and  Mombert,  Toller  and  Weissi,  Brod  and  Arnold  Zweig,  Doeblin  and  Beer-Hoffmann  are  only  a  few  names  casually  picked  out  of  the  innumerable  spiritual  Jews  who  have  influenced  the  thoughts  and  feelings  of  the  Ger  man  people.   It  is  practically  impossible  even  if  the  limited  space  would  not  prohibit  it—to  mention  every  do   main  where  the  Jews  had  a  share  in  the  shaping  of  German  culture.  Industry  and  economicsi,  sociology  and  agriculture,  film  and  theatre  dance  and  architecture,  journal  istics  and  playwriting,  charity  and   art-donations  were  but  a  few  ones  of  the  vast  provinces  of  Jewish   collaboration.   How  is  it  possible  that  in  spite  of  all  this  cultural  work  done  by  Jews  the  terrible  outbursts  of  cruelty  against  the  German  Jews  could  happen  ?  Probably  because  the  people  did  not  know  how  great   the  share  of  the  Jews-  in  all  those  cultural  achievements  had  been.   For  however  magnificent  the  Jewish  accomplishments  were  they  did  not  reach  the  bulk  of  the  people.  The  ideas  of  the  Jewish  writers'  were  too  elaborate,  too  high-brow,  to  be  understood  by  the  masses.  They  became  the  spi  ritual  food  of  the  intelligentsia  with  the  exception  of  Heine  whose   poems  are  recited  and  sung  by  the  whole  of  Germany,  .  but  .  mostly  without  any  knowledge  who  wrote  those  deeply  touching  songs.  And  again  the  composers  although  some  of  thefn  being  pacemakers  of  new  musical  ways  did  not  pene  trate  into  the  people’s  hearts,  be  side  Mendelssohn  whose  songs  went  straight  to  the  people’s  feel  ings.  And  even  men  who  achieved  the  most  practical  successes  like  Haber  who  saved  Germany  from  losing  the  world  war  in  its  first  year,  or  Ehrlich  who  released  the  world  from  one  of  its  deadliest  plagues,  were  not  popular  because  the  simple-minded  maxi,  could  not  conceive  their  complicated  con  structive  work.   Shall  we  wonder  about  it?  No,  for  not  even  the  Jewish  ^masses  knew  it.  Even  now  after  the  last  years  of  Jewish  persecution  and  reawakening  of  Jewish  conscious  ness  a  French  Jew  with  whom  I  conversed  recently  had  no  idea  that  Bergson  and  Andre  Maurois   were  Jews  and  Anatole  France  half  of  Jewish  parentage.   Must  we  therefore  assume  that  all  the  cultural  work  done  by  Jews  has  been  in  vain?  Certainly  not.  Material  values  can  be  lost,  money,  houses,  diamonds  can  be  destroyed  but  spiritual  values  that  have  been  produced  remain..  Books  which  have  been  printed  can  be  burnt  but  their  contents  cannot  be  burned.  Heads  can  be  cut  off.but  thoughts  which  they  had  spoken  out,  the  songs  which  have  been  sung,  cannot  been  drowned,  smoth  ered,  hanged.  The  cultural  achive  ments  the  Jews  have  produced  in  Germany  will  be  remain  alive  and  there  will  be  again  a  time  of  peace  when  all  that  Einstein  and  Freud,  Mendelssohn  and  Heine  have  thought,  said,  written  and  sung,  will  again  be  heard,  read  and  sung,  and  when  again  will  be  thought  of  with  deep  and  kind  feelings  of  thankfulness  those  men  who  have  served  the  progress  of  man  with  the  best  of  their  lives.   But  something  more  will  come  out  again  of  the  marvellous  riches  of  Jewish  spirit.  Those  riches  which  have  survived  the  centuries   of  prosecution  will  remain  in  the  same  way  alive  in  spite  df  the  new  pains  that  have  come  down  over  Jewry.  The  men  who  have  pro  duced  all  those  miracles  of  their  spirits  have  had  to  go  again  on  their  new  travels  throughout  the  world.  They  had  to  leave  behind  them  their  fortunes,  their  money,  even  their  clothes.  But  they  have  taken  along  with  thentselves  their  unbroken  spirit.  That  spirit  wher  ever  the  Jews  will  be  driven  out   and  wherever  they  ‘  will  settle  afresh  will  fructify  again  mankind  for  the  benefit  of  the  human  race  and  to  the  honour  of  the  Jewish   name.",1942-07-10T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/263079241,"The Jews are endowed with surprising spiritual gifts.

261593214,GERMAN JEWS AND GERMAN CULTURE,"  GERMAN  JEWS  AND   GERMAN  CULTURE   By  ARNO  WITTEN   rne  Jews  are  endowed  with  sur   prising  spiritual  gifts.  There  is  one  domain  of  their  own,  the  pro  vince  of  religious  and  moral-  otnics  where  the  great  deeds  of  this  small  people  have  shaped  the  diuihari  history  of  millenniums.  The  spreading  of  the  idea  of  the  (dne,'.'spiritual  '  and  invisible  God,  the  creation  of  the  Bible,  the  mo  rals  and  teachings  of  Moses,  'Christ,;  Spinoza  and  Marx  have  in  fluenced  mankind  more  than  the   of  the  Egyptians,  the  geogra  phical  explorings  of  the  Vikings,  the  laws  of  .  the  Romans,  the  war  deeds  of  Alexander  or  of  Ghengis  Khan;  ,  ,   •  Although  a  people  that  .  has  formed  the  shape  and  idea  of  human  life  throughout  the  civili  sed  world  has  certainly  fulfilled  the  task  which  history  has  laid  on  it  the  Jews  have  over  that  pro  duced  miracles  also  in  the  sphere  of  general  human  culture.  And  specially  so  in  Germany,  the  coun  try  that  to-day  denies  them  every  valuable  quality  of  mind  and  soul.   Their  contributions  to  art  arid  science  are  almost  inconceivable.  The,'rhore  so  if  we  consider  that   the^‘have1  been  kept  away  from  any  Collaboration  with,  and  even  from  the  admission  to,  almost  any  form  of  cultural  life  since  time   immemorial.  No.  one  would  expect  people  whxi.ihad  been  forced  to  live  in  open  country  and  to  whom  the  do,1ors.  ,have  suddenly  -  been  opened  to  rush  into  the  building,  to  piill'  down  immediately  the  old   wall's  and  to  erect  better  ones.   They  must  first.,find  out  their  way  in  the  new  surroundings  and  to  accomodate  themselves.  (It  is  only  a  little  more  than  a  century  since  the  Jews  have  been  permit  ted  to  join  the  European  life  with  equal  1  rights—and  that  indeed  only  formally,'  not  even  practic  ally_and  this  permission  has  al  ready  been  revoked  again,  It  is  instructive  to  remember  that  crpel.  fact.  We  sometimes  forget  it),...   .  Besides  that,  there  is  another;  reaspn  why  all  those,  achievements;  must  be  -classified  -in  the,  highest  ranks  of.  human  successes.  ,For  also-  after  their-,  admission  to  the  European  dinner-table  they  were   not  served  the  same  -  dishes  -as   their,  fellow-beings.  If  the  Jews  made  the  most  yalUable  contribu   tions  to:  the  welfare;  of  the  civi-  •   lised  society  it  was  not-certain  at\   'all.  that  the-  contributions  were  ;   appreciated,  as.,  -they  .infallibly;  Would  have  been  with  their  fellow,  scientists  and.  -fellow-artists.  If;  the-.Jews  received  -any  rewards  of  1  their  ,  endeavours  at  all  then  there   was  almost  always  connected  with  ;  it..  some  hu-miliatinsr  Although  ;  they  may.  have  been  winners  of  the  Nobel-prize,  or  they  may  have  gained  .  the..  admiration  of  •  :the  Whole  civilised  world,  as  for,  -in  stance-.  Einstein,  who  changed  the  luiman.  outlook  on  eternity,  or  Freud  who  opened  new  perspec  tives  j.of  men’s  cognition,  they  wore?  ,not  ^  regarded  as  .  digniifed  enough  to  become  ordinary  tea  ohers-at.  the  university.  „  •   ;  Bnt  .  in  spite  of  those  handicaps,  which,  proved  only  that  anti-Jew  ish-feelings  neyer  had  practically  Ceased  to  exist,  the  Jewish  fight  ers;  -for;;  the  develo  pm  ent  of  man  kindL-gave-iths^best  of  their  hearts  for?  tthes?  ;beneiit  j  of  t  the.'  .human  so  ciety  iimbuedowifchathh  -ardent  dess   sire  to  further,  the  progress  of  the  human  race;.  And  it  is  almost  in  er-jdiblh  hpw  hiafvellously  they  succeeded  in  nearly  every  cultural  province:   At  first  thought  it  may  seem  not  worth  the  while  to  remember  what  the  Jews  have  achieved  in  Germany  and  for  Germany.  In  deed  the  wheels  of  history  will  not  be  turned  into  any  other  direction  by  the  statement  how  much  the  Jews  have  added  to  the  benefit  of  German  name  and  German  fame.  But  it  will  buttress  the  proud  and  the  certain  feeling  of  the  Jews  themselves  that  one  day  when  the  waves  of  hatred  will  have  been  calmed  down  Jewish  accomplishments  will  be  recognis  ed  again  and  that  the  world  will  give  the  Jews  that  place  in  the  council  of  peoples  for  which  they   are  entitled  to  claim.   \Vhen  the  Jews  in  the  beginning  of  the  19  th  century  were—at  least  formally—-admitted  as  equal  to'  the  community  of  free  men  in  Germany,  it  :was  as  if  a  bulwark  had  been  broken  down  and  the   water  dammed  up  behind  it  had  fallen  like  a  torrent  into  the  open  land.  So  powerful  was  the  mental  energy  that  became  free  and  ru  shed  down  into  every  district  of  spiritual  activity.  Impossible  to  count  down  every  Jew  who  has   added  stones  to  the  edifice  of  Ger  man  art  and  science.  We  can  give  only  a  few  names  out  of  thou  sands.  But  we  can  appraise  the  real  significance  of  that  powerful  stream  of  spiritual  fructification  only  if  we  consider  that  the  Jews  comprising  but  1  per  cent  of  the  German  population  at  once  took  part  in  the  building  up  of  the  cul  tural  life  by  contributors  out  numbering  10  or  even  20  times  their  actual  proportion  of  the  po  pulation.  An  example  may  make  it  clear  how  this  miraculous  fact  turned  out  to  be  of  almost  in  credible  effects:  The  Jews  for  in  stance  brought  forth  9  remarkable  composers  in  a  little  more  than  one  century-  the  Germans,  in  or  der  to  keep  pace  should  have  had  to  muster  900  (  !  )  equivalent  ta  lents  or  take  another  example:  About  25  per  cent  of  the  German  Nobel-prize  winners  .  were  Jews,  equal  to  five  times:  more  :than  their*  proportion.'  ’And  -'  so  :  ,it  ■  was  in  nearly  every  district  of  cultural   life.-.'  !  v"".   the  beginning  of  that  “Pe  riod  of  Enlightenment”  stands  the   y^'neratde  figure  of  t.he  poor  hunch   backed  office  clerk  and  great  philosopher  .  Moses  Mendelssohn,   t^e.  friend  of  Lessing.  He  was  still   deep-rooted,  in  Jewish  feelings,  and  it  was  .but.in  his  adult  years  that  he-.:  learnt,  to  write  German.  Pro  found,  was  his  influence  ""on  Ger  man  philosophy.  (The  fate  of  his  Children  is  significant;  it'  shows  how  quickiy  by  the  way.  of  assi  milation  large  and  valuable  parts  of  Jewry  have  been  absorbed,  by  the  German  people;  Two  of  his  sons,  baptized,  became  the  found  ers  of  one  of  most  famous  Euro  pean.  Banks.  His  daughter,  .also  baptised,  was  renowned  for  her  literary  salon  and  played  an  im  portant  part  in  the  history  of  Ger  man  literature.  His  grandson  Felix  Mendelssohn-Bartholdy,  baptised,  was  one  of  the  greatest  German  composers.  And  many  of  his  des  cendents  :  are  •  reputed  as  artists   and,  scientistsi).  isesicies  ivienciei  ssohn  there  were  many  more  Jew  ish  philosophers  as  for  instance  Salomon  Maimon,  Otto  Liebmann,  Herman  Cohen,  Gustav  Simmel,  Gustav  Landauer  etc.  Although,  they  were  not  the  great  lonely  stars  they  influenced  largely  thoughts  and  ideas  in  Germany.   In  the  discipline  of  Physics,  Mathematics  and  Physics  near  to  the  province  of  Philosophy,  scores  of  Jews  excelled.  The  one  Einstein  would  suffice  to  procure  the  Jews  a  place  of  honour  in  the  history  of  Science.  Only  the  coming  cen  turies  can  judge  fully  his  import  ance.  But  he  seems  to  be  a  genius  the  like  of  whom  mankind  pro  duces  only  every  some  centuries  to  be  placed  in  line  with  men  like  Ptolemy,  Galileo,  Giordano  Bruno  and  Newton.  And  there  are  many  others  whose  names  can  keep  the  field  also  besides  Einstein.  Hertz  (theory  of  electric  waves),  J.  Frank  (theory  of  atoms),  David  sohn  (electro  motor),  Marcus  (petrol  motor),  Berliner  (micro  phone),  Haber  (nitrogen),'  Frank  (Kali),  Caro  (dyes),  Willstaetter  (Chlorophyl),  Bayer,  the  son  of  a  Jewish  mother  and  the  founder  of  the  mighty  German  Dye  concern  (indigo)  and  practically  thou   sands  of  famous  names  more.   Jews  have  always  been  prepon  derant  physicians  and  that  may  partly  explain  the  fact  that  there  was  nearly  no  inventive  medical  achievement  without  Jewish  guid  ance  or  at  least  Jewish  assistance.  It  is  almost  impossible  an  under  taking  to  enumerate  the  names  of  the  countless  medical  pioneers  and  only  a  few  ones  may  therefore  be  mentioned  who  acquired  wide  pub  lic  fame.  So  Meyerhof  (transfor  mation  of  energy),  Zunz  (physio  logy),  Ehrlich  (Salvarsan),  Was  sermann  and  Morgenroth  (both  diagnosis  of  syphilis,  Freud  (psychoanalysis),  Adler  (indivi  dual  psychology),  Minkowsky  (diabetes),  Boas  (stomach  di  seases)  ,  Zondeck  (internal  di  seases),  Aschheim  (pregnancy  diagnosis)  etc.   But  how  much  soever.  all  these  contributions  have  added  to  the  famous  reputation  of  German  cul  ture  the  public  in  general  knew  and  appreciated  better  the  Jews,  who  worked  in  the  sphere  of  the  arts.   In  the  first  line  it  was  the  Jew  ish  musicians  who,  even  in  the  land  of  music  proper,  attracted  the  eyes  or  rather  the  ears  of  their  contemporaries.  There  are  the  composers  Mendelssohn,  Mey  erbeer,  dffenbach,  Moscheles,  Ru   binstein,  Joachim,  Mahler,  Schoen  berg,  Korngold,  there  are  the  con  ducted  Walter,  Klemperer,  Klei  ber,  there  are  the  countless  prac  titioning  musicians  of  world-wide  fame  like  Schnabel,  Horowitz,  Ser  kin,  Hubermarin,  Kreisler,  Morini,  Tauber  arid  scores  of  theni  more.   In  the-  art  of  painting  it  ’  was  Lieberinarin,  Israels,  Lesser  Ury,  Chagall;  Feinger,,  Marees  (a  ,half  Jew)  etc.  who  helped  to  develop  German  artistic  reputation.  That  seems  to  be  indeed  a  very  surpris  ing  fact.  For-since  the  Jewa,  -pre  vented  by  religious  prohibitions,  had  riever  excelled  iri  the  field  ;of  painting  it  was  all  the  mrir^.ihir.,  acuious  that  they  .could  hold  their  own  without  ’any  existing1  artistic  tradition.  **  /■V   v  (Continued  6n  page  ‘t   GERMAN  JEWS  AND  GERMAN  CULTURE   (Continued  from  Front  page)   Always  have  the  Jews  been  bear  ers  of  a  deep  inner  conscience  and  masters  of  the  word.  Since  the  days  of  the  Prophets  they  have  been  the  proclaimed  and  propa  gators  of  teachings,  doctrines  and  convictions.  That  may  be  the  ex  planation  of  the  immense  part  played  by  Jews  in  the  German  literature.  The  way  leading  from  Heinrich  Heine  to  Stephan  Zweig  is  short  in  time  but  overcrowded  by  writing,  composing,  teaching  and  admonishing  Jews:  Boerne  and  Weininger,  Wassermann  and  Werfel,  Kaffka  and  Heimann,  Schnitzler  and  Hofmannsthal,  Bu  ber  and  Mombert,  Toller  and  Weiss,  Brod  and  Arnold  Zweig,  Doeblin  and  Beer-Hoffmann  are   only  a  few  names  casually  picked  out  of  the  innumerable  spiritual  Jews  who  have  influenced  the   thoughts  and  feelings  of  the  Ger  man  people.   It  is  practically  impossible  even  if  the  limited  space  would  not  prohibit  it—to  mention  every  do  main  where  the  Jews  had  a  share  in  the  shaping  of  German  culture.  Industry  and  economics:,  sociology  and  agriculture,  film  and  theatre  dance  and  architecture,  journal  istics  and  playwriting,  charity  and  art-donations  were  but  a  few  ones   of  the  vast  provinces  of  Jewish   collaboration.   How  is  it  possible  that  in  spite  of  all  this  cultural  work  done  by  Jews  the  terrible  outbursts  of  cruelty  against  the  German  Jews  could  happen  ?  Probably  because  the  people  did  not  know  how  great  the  share  of  the  Jews  in  all  those  cultural  achievements  had  been.   For  however  magnificent  the  Jewish  accomplishments  were  they  did  not  reach  the  bulk  of  the  people.  The  ideas  of  the  Jewish  writers'  were  too  elaborate,  too  high-brow,  to  be  understood  by  the  masses.  They  became  the  spi  ritual  food  of  the  intelligentsia,  with  the  exception  of  Heine  whose  poems  are  recited,  and  sung  by  the  whole  of  Germany,  but  mostly  without  any  knowledge  who  wrote  those  deeply  touching  songs.  And  again  the  composers  although  some  of  them  being  pacemakers  of  new  musical  ways  did  not  pene  trate  into  the  people’s  hearts,  be   side  Mendelssohn  whose  songs  went  straight  to  the  people’s  feel  ings.  And  even  men  who  achieved  the  most  practical  successes  like  Haber  who  saved  Germany  from   losing  the  world  war  in  its  first  I  year,  or  Ehrlich  who  released  the  world  from  one  of  its  deadliest  plagues,  were  not  popular  because  the  simple-minded  man  could  not  conceive  their  complicated  con   structive  work.   Shall  we  wonder  about  it?  No,  for  not  even  the  Jewish  masses  knew  it.  Even  now  after  the  last  years  of  Jewish  persecution  and  reawakening  of  Jewish  conscious  ness  a  French  Jew  with  whom  I  conversed  recently  had  no  idea  that  Bergson  and  Andre  Maurois  were  Jews  and  Anatole  France  half  of  Jewish  parentage.   Must  we  therefore  assume  that  all  the  cultural  work  done  by  Jews  has  been  in  vain?  Certainly  not.  Material  values  can  be  lost,  money,  houses,  diamonds  can  .be  destroyed  but  spiritual  values  that  have  been  produced  remain.  Books  which  have  been  printed  can  be  burnt  but  their  contents  cannot  be   |  burned.  Heads  can  be  cut  off  but   thoughts  which  they  had  spoken  out,  the  songs  which  have  been  sung,  cannot  been  drowned,  smoth  ered,  hanged.  The  cultural  achive  ments  the  Jews  have  produced  in.  Germany  will  be  remain  alive  and  there  will  be  again  a  time  of  peace  when  all  that  Einstein  and  Freud,  Mendelssohn  and  Heine  have  thought,  said,  written  and  sung,  will  again  be  heard,  read  and  sung,  and  when  again  will  be  thought  of  with  deep  and  kind  feelings  of  thankfulness  those  men  who  have  served  the  progress  of  man  with  the  best  of  their  lives.   But  something  more  will  come  out  again  of  the  marvellous  riches  of  Jewish  spirit.  Those  riches  which  have  survived  the  centuries  of  prosecution  will  remain  in  the  same  way  alive  in  spite  of  the  new  pains  that  have  come  down  over  Jewry.  The  men  who  have  pro  duced  all  those  miracles  of  their  spirits  have  had  to  go  again  on  their  new  travels  throughout  the  world.  They  had  to  leave  behind  them  their  fortunes,  their  money,  even  their  clothes.  But  they  have  taken  along  with  themselves  their  unbroken  spirit.  That  spirit  wher  ever  the  Jews  will  be  driven  out  and  wherever  they  will  settle  afresh  will  fructify  again  m  inkind  for  the  benefit  of  the  human  race  and  to  the  honour  of  the  Jewish   name.",1942-07-03T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/261593214,"The Jews are endowed with surprising spiritual gifts.

Here  is  the  text  of  the  German  religion   1.—The  German  has.  his  own  re  ligion,  which  flows-  like  the  living  water  of  his  own  -^perception,  .feeling  and""  thought,  and  is  rooted  .in  his  species.'.-  We  call  it  the  German  Re  ligion,  or.  the  religion  of  the  German  people,  and  understand  thereby  a  Ger   man  Faith  caressing  the  peculiarity  i  and  the  integrity  of  the  race.   2.—The  German  religion  -is  the  lorm  of  faith  appropriate  to  our  age,  which  we  Germans  would  have  today  if  it  had  been  granted  tb  us  to  have  our  native.German  religion  developed  un  disturbed  fo  the  present  time.   3.—TheGerman  of-today  requires  a  healthy  and;  natural  religion  which;  makes  him  brave,  pious  and  strong  in  the  struggle  Jor  people  and  Father  land;  such  a  religion  is  the  German  religion.  '   Comments-—What  is  a  healthy  and  natiural  religion?  is  a  religion:  without  the  phenomena  of  disease  and  degeneration.  .  To  this  Christianity  does  not  belong.  .  Christianity  is  in  deed  an  unhealthy  and  unnatural  .re  ligion.  which  is  at  an  end.  For.  it  arose  2,000  years  ago  among  sick,  ex  hausted  and  despairing  men,  who  h^d  lost,  their  belief  in  life,  ""who  had  des  pised  .-the  world,  and  who  waited""  for   the  return  of;  Christ  and  the  destruc-  j   tion  of  .  the  world.   .4.—The  German  religion  recognises  no  dogma,  for  it  is  a  religion.'   5.—The  German  religion  is  not  a  re  ligion  of  revelation  in  the  Christian  sense,  ""  it  rests  rather  upon  a  natural  revelation  ,of  the  Divine  forces  in  the  world  and  in  the  human  mind.   6.—The  German  religion  is  the  re  ligion  of  the  people.  It  has_nothing  to  do""  with  free  througlit,  atheist  pro  paganda  and  the  ^disintegration  (Zersetzung).  of  reigion.  We.  who  are  genuine  .followers  of  German  religion  talce  our  stand  on  the  basis  of  a  posi  tive  religion.   Comments:—Where  Christianity  stops,  there..our  religion,  begins.  Be   lief  in  a  personal  God,  in  revelation  ,  and  salvation  is  all  superstition,  not  religion.  The  biologically  educated  man  ,  seeks  the  solution  of  his  moral  and  religious  problems  in  the  Cosmos,   in  nature,-  and  the  world  of  reality,  in  .  blood  and  soil,  people  and  home,  na-  j   tion  and  Fatherland.  Our  religion  is   no  longer  the  International  Christ-.j   God  which  could  not  -  prevent  Ver-  'j  sailles.  *  Our  religion  isr""-what  grows  I  living  within  us>  the  great,  sacred,  glowing  desire  to  wash  away  1,000  years  of  German  sorrow,  and  make  good  the  sins  of  the  Jewish-Christian  alien  religion  against  the  German  soul.   7.—The  German  religion  is  riot  hos  tile  to  a  church.  It  seeks  a  German  church  on  the  basis  of  a  religious  people.   8.—God  is  a  moral  idea  to  which  we  are  bound  by  the  eternal  creative  force  of  nature  which  works  in  the  world  and  man.  Belief  in  another-worldly  God  is  not  of  Indo-Germanic,  but  of  Semitic  origin'.  This-kind  of  God-be  lief  is  not  a  condition  of  true  religion  and  piety   9.—In  the  lap  of  ""  the  divine,  living  world  the  knowing  being  or  mind  grows.  Mind,  is  a  natural  growth  of   the  .  world  of  reality.  It  is  not  a  finished  thing  at  the  height  of  world   development.   10.—To  God's  being  belong  will,  un  derstanding  (verstand)  and  personal  ity.  These  are,  however,  unique  in  man.  Hence  man'  is  the  place  (Ort)   of  God  in  the~  world.   -  11.—Man  is  not  God.  But  he  is  God's  birthplace.  God  exists  and  grows  in  man.  If  God  does  not  come  in  man,  He  never  comes.  Hence  the  German  religion  is  the  religion  of  high   faith  in  man.   12.—The  German  religion  recognises  no  dualism  .or  conflict-  between  body  and  soul,  any  more'than  duality  and  conflict  between  God  and  the  world,  and  God  and  man.  We  think  of  the  being,  body-soul,  as  a  natural  unity  and  entity.   Comments—""Crucify  thy  flesh,""  was  the  demand  of  the  Esthetic  Chris  tian  ethics  of  decadence,  which  over  looked  that  at  the  same,  time  the  mind  was  crucified.  For  in  a  sick  and  tor  tured  flesh""  dwells  a.  sick  or  tor  tured  mtad.;  -In  tSe  National  Socialist  State  this  dualistic  Christian  anthropo  logy  is  completely'but''of  .date.  .  Who  ever  seeks  to  weed  the  -  inferior  and  cultivate  tlie  gifted  and  tlie  best  of  our  ~  inheritance,  whoever  seeks  a  social-aristocracy,  can  be  no  longer  Christian;,  For  Christianity  is  the  re  ligious  form  of  Social  Democracy.  Both  are  international,  ""democratic  and  be  lieving-  in  human.  equality.   13.—-The  living  world  is  the  Womb  Mother  of  the  high  '  human  mind.  Knowing,  being,  and  mind  is.  the  foirtb  'of  the-All-Mother.'  The  Mother-child   thought  is  hence  the  right  indication  of  the  God-world  secret.  We  speak  in  a  modern  nature  religion  of  the""  Mind-child""  God,  who  rests  iii  the   womb  of  the  All-Mother.   14.—The  feelings  of  ""union,  holiness  and  blessedness  are  the  basic  religious  ""■feelings.  ""The  .Christian  feelings  of  sin,  guilt,  and  repentance;  are  not  re-:  ligious  feelings  at  all.  They,  are  arti  ficially  engendered  complexes  in  man.   15.—The  ethics  of  the  German  re  ligion  ""condemns  all  belief  in  inherited  sin,  as  well  as  the-  Jewish-Christian  teaching  of  a  fallen  world  and  ""man.  Such  a  teaching  is  not  only.  non-Ger  manic  and  non-German,  it  is  immoral  and  non-religious.  Whoever  preaches  this,  menaces  the  morality  of  the  people.   16.—Whoever  forgives  sin,-  sanctions  sin.

144000790,GERMAN BARBARISM,"  GERMAN  BARBARISM   With  tumors  of  peace  feelers  by  the  Germans  being  widely  circulated  in  both  hemispheres,  and  questions  arising  concerning  the  political  future  of  Germany,  It  is  timely  that  official  revela  tions  should  have  been  made  of  the  Blmost  unbelievable  barbarity  that  has  been  openly  practised  by  the  Germans  In  countries  which  their  armies  have  overrun.  Such  disclosures  will  also  serve  to  counter  any  misplaced  pity  that  may  be  felt  at  the  increasingly  heavy  bombing  of  Berlin,  nerve-centre  and  core  of  the  whole  vile  creation  of  Naddom.   The  Polish  authorities  have  already  unearthed  evidence  J'  abundance  of  the  wholesale  slaughter  of  civilians  in  that  desolate  country.  Stories  of  trainloads  of  men,  women  and  children  setting  out  for  'murder  centres,'  there  to  be  deliberately  and  ruthlessly  machine-gunned  or  forced  into  lethal  chambers  and  gassed,  have  been  told  repeatedly  by  escapees  and  others.  Such  stories  are  too  persistent  and  factual  to  be  doubted.  They  be  token  an  attitude  towards  human  life  and  suffering  that  Is  alto  gether  foreign  to  British  civilisation—  a  foul  philosophy  of  sadism  which  appears  to  permeate  the  whole  German  nation.  Now  the  special  Russian  committee  which  is  Investigating  Nail  atrocities  in  the  Donets  Basin  has  brought  to  Ugbt  a  series  of  atrocities  equally  as  appalling,  and  entirely  In  keeping  wltn  the  German  practice  in  occupied  countries.  The  bodies  of  thou  sands  of  civilians  have  been  dug  up  from  coal  pits  and  quarries,  where  they  were  buried  by  the  Germans,  while  no  fewer  than  25,000  Russians  were  found  buried  near  the  Stalino  prisoner  of  war  camp.  Horrible  stories  of  torture  have  also  been  told,  and  the  Bnsslan  committee  has  ascertained  the  names  of  90  military  officers  and  Gestapo  officials  who  win  be  held  responsible  for  these  crUnes,  Equally  appalling  are  the  revelations  that  have  just  been  made  by  the  Inter-AIIied  Information  Committee  concerning  the  German  treatment  of  women  in  occupied  countries.  Women  nave  been  reduced  to  the  level  of  slaves.  The  Gestapo  never  hesitates  to  use  its  -expert  tortures  in  an  effort  to  make  women  lncriminate  their  menfolk,  states  the  report.  Trilling  offences  are  made  an   excuse  for  Imprisonment  and  deportation,  ana  sms  ««  abducted—a  systematic  policy  of  the  German  authorities.

259711696,GERMAN MORALE,"  GERMAN  MORALE   One  of  the  most  encouraging  developments  of  recent  weeks  has  been  tne  increasing  reference  to  the  decline  in  (iern.au  morale.  This  is  not  the  result  of  wishful  thinking,  or  even  inspired  comment  from  neutral  sources  who  might  imagine  that  we  are  anxious  to  hear  that  German  morale  was  declining.  It  comes  from  such  authoritative  a  source  as  Dr.  Josef  Goebells  himself.  Dr.  Goebells  does  not,  of  course,  refer  to  it  in  so  many  words,  but  he  does  refer  rather  significantly  to  '  temporary  weakness,""  and  he  reiterates  with  monotonous  regularity  the  fact  that  1918  ""was  a  unique  and  tragic  event  in  our  history  which  will  not,  and  cannot,  be  repeated.""  It  will  be  remembered  ""-iuuuuuicu  that  mat  in  his  nis  ast  Herr  Hitler  adopted  the  same  lone,  and  very  obviously  the  lears  of  1918  are  looming  very  large  on  the  German  canvas.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  differences  between  the  present  time  and  1918  are  not  so  very  marked.  At  this  stage  of  the  last  war,  both  Turkey  and  Bulgaria  had  been  forced  out  rather  in  the  same  way  as  Italy  has  been  forced  out  this  time.  The  crippling  defeats  which  the  German  army  is  suffering  on  the  eastern  front  were  being  emulated  on  the  western  front  of  the  last  war.  And  to  this  similarity  must  be  added  the  increasing  cost   of  the  U-boat  campaign,  which  is,  ,  lor  all  practical  purposes,  as  great  a  failure  loday  as  it  was  at  the  beginning,  of  1918.  But  there  is  another  and  very  important  difference  in  the  situation—tiie  first,  which  favours  the  United  Nations,  is  the  fact  that  Germany  is  being  iiit  far  harder  from  the  air  than  was  possible  during  the  last  war.  The  second,  winch  is  in  favour  of  Germany  is  the  fact  that  the  Nazis  have  a  much  more  stringent  and  brutal  dis-  *  lpunc  of  the  civilian  population  than  did  the  Kaiser's  Government  of  Lie  last  war.  Consequently,  u  would  be  foolish  to  anticipate  au  iitinn  diate  earl  j  collapse  of  the  Cer  mans,  although  this  is  by  no  means  impossible.  It  must  not,  however,  be  expected.  At  the  same  time  it  looks  very  much  as  though  the  German  leaders  themselves  are  not  too  hopeful.  This  constant  reiteration  of  PJLS  is  an  indication  of  how  much  it  is  preying  on  their  minds.  No  doubt,  before  the  end,  Ihe  German  people  will  de  cide  whether  they  prefer  certain  death  from  the  air—or  their  men  folks  on  the  lighting  fronts  of  Europe—or  whether  they  prefer  to  risk  death  lighting  their  greatest  enemy,  ihe  Nazi  leaders  themselves.  Very  obviously  the  position  inside  !  Germany  is  deteriorating  very  sub  stajilially,  and  the  task  ahead  o  1  the  United  Nations  now  is  to  see  that  lull  advantage  is  taken  of  this  declining  morale,  and  that  the  offensive  strength  of  the  Allies  is  used  Lo  tile  utmost  lo  smash  down  Lerinan  tyranny,  The  fighting  in  Italy  and  in  Russia  is  prov  ing  a  tremendous  dilliculty  tor  the  Germans.

47671875,GERMAN GOVERNMENT,"  GERMAN  GOVERNMENT  With  the  formation  of  Dr.  Adenauer's  right-wing  coali  tion  Government,  the  West  Gernman  Federal  Republic  has  now  been  launched  and  the  Occupation  Statute,  which  de  fines  the  rights  of  the  western  Allied  Powers  pending  the  con  clusion  of  a  peace  treaty,  has  simultaneously  come  into  force.  The  new  republic,  founded  on  the  democratic  parliamentary  principles  of  the  Bonn  Consti  tution,  is  not  yet  a  fully  sove  reign  State,  for  it  is  subject  to  discretionary  Allied  control.  Nor  is  the  structure  of  the  Re  public  complete,  for  it  has  not  been  possible  to  include  the  Russian  zone.  But,  within  those  limits,  a  self-governing  Ger?jp  State  has  been  brought  into  being  by  the  Western  Powers.  It  is  a  fateful  experiment.  The  willingness  and  capacity  of  the  German  people  to  make  a  re  presentative  parliamentary  sys  tem  work,  which  has  already  failed  once  in  the  destruction  of  the  Weimar  Republic  by  Hitler's  Nazism,  is  again  being  put  to  the  test  in  a  very  difficult  post  war  stage.  The  outcome,  politically  and  economically,  will  have  a  profound  influence  on  the  future  of  Europe  and  the  task  of  Dr.  Adenauer  as  the  first  Chancellor,  is  one  of  the  gravest  responsibility.  The  return  of  germany  to  a  proper  place  in  the  European  and  world  community  has  been  facilitated  by  the  Western  Powers.  But  there  will  be  need  for  sound  evidence  of  German  attachment  to  peaceable  demo  cratic  practice  and  of  a  genu  inely  cooperative  spirit  to  justify  the  next  step,  which  would  presumably  be  admis  sion  to  the  Council  of  Europe.  The  greatest  danger,  as  always  in  German  politics,  must  come  from  the  lack  of  any  ingrained  parliamentary  tradition  and  the  struggle  of  extremists  on  the  right  and  the  left  to  overthrow  the  moderate  democrats  and  seize  authoritarian  power.  A  stabilising  factor,  however,  is  that  the  two  major  parties-the  Christian  Democrats  in  office  and  the  Social  Democrats  in  opposition-stand  firmly  for  constitutional  and  democratic  principles.  The  Christian  Democrats,  although  the  larg  est  party  in  the  Federal  Lower  House,  have  only  139  seats  out  of  402.  Under  Dr.  Aden  auer's  leadership  they  de  clined  to  seek  a  Government  with  the  Social  Democrats  (131  seats)  because  of  deep  divisions  on  economic  policy.  Dr.  Aden  auer  therefore  looked  to  the  smaller  parties  on  his  right  and  he  has  formed  a  coalition  with  the  conservative  .  Free  Democrats  and  the  strongly  nationalist  German  Party.  It  is  a  coalition,  however,  which  has  an  extremely  narrow  ma  jority.  Dr.  Adenauer's  pro  blem,  in  which  the  Western  Powers  have  an  acute  and  ap  prehensive  interest,  will  be  to  resist  dictation  from  the  right  and  to  hold  in  check  the  re  vival  of  nationalism  which  was  so  strongly  marked  in  the  elec  tion.",1949-09-22T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/47671875,"With the formation of Dr. Adenauer's right-wing coalition Government, the West German Federal Republic has",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47671875?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1940-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1949-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The West Australian (Perth, WA : 1879 - 1954)",135.32130432128906,very relevant

261714636,GERMAN MIGRATION GERMAN MIGRATION,"  GERMAN  MIGRATION   OPPOSED  BY  E.C.A.J.  CONFERENCE   GERMAN  MIGRATION   In  his  address  about  German   migration  to  Australia,  Mr.  £in   feld  stated  that  the  Committee   of  Management  has  continued  its  representations  to  the  Gov  ernment  in  opposition  to  the   continuous  intake  of  Germans  as  favoured  migrants  to  Aus  tralia.  It  is  regretted  that  the  Government  seems  determined  to  continue.  with  this  policy,  and  it  is  distressing  to  learn  that  2638  Germans  have  been  admitted  to  Australia  in  the  first  quarter  of  1954.   I  have  learnt  that  the  Gov  ernment  expect  approximately  9000  Germans  .  who  are  to  be  skilled  artisans  to  come  to  Aus   tralia  during  the  next  twelve   months.   In  regard  to  German  migra   tion  we  had  been  told  that  no  more  than  3,000-4,000  Germans  would  be  admitted—but  accord   ing  to  the  report  the  position  has  changed,  as  the  Government  will  bring'  9,000  Germans  to  this  country.  What  are  the  plans  of  the  Committee  of  Management?  Are  you  going  to  acquiesce  or  should  we  do  something  about  this  new  situa  tion.'We  want  an  objective  as   sessment  of  the  situation  and   guidance  for  our  policy.   The  delegate  from  S.A.,  Mr.  Hines,  expressed  the  desire  that  the  immigration  of  some  unsuit   able  elements  of  other  nationali   ties  (Poles,  Lithuanians,  etc.)   should  also  be  included  in  the  orbit  of  our  attention.   Mr.  H.  B.  Newman  (N.S.W.)   defended  the  policy  pursued  by  the  Committee  of  Manage  ment  in  this  delicate  political   issue.   Mr.  Wolfensohn  referred  to   the  fact  that  inquiries  were  made  on  the  point  raised  by  Mr.  Hines,  but  no  answer  has  come  from  the  competent  authority.   An  interesting  debate  de  veloped  on  the  discrimination  inflicted  on  a  company  which  wanted  to  deal  with  $audi  Arabia  and  invoked  the   E.C.A.J.  intervention  with  the   Australian  and  British  Govern   ment  against  such  discrimina  tion.  The  prevailing  opinion  was  that  an  approach  to  the   Crown  should  be  made  only  it|.  a  matter  of  vital  policy.   Answering  Mr.  Ben  Green,   Mr.  Einfeld  stated  that  the  Committee  of  Management  was  not  idle,  but  has  repeatedly   intervened  with  the  Govern*   ment  from  September,  1953,  on  this  issue  and  it  has  finally  been  settled  by  the  combined  efforts  of  N.S.W.  and  Victoria.'   As  to  the  dissatisfaction  re,   German  migration,  Mr.  Einfeld  said  with  emphasis:  “I  d<?n’t  know  of  any  new  method  how  to  fight  German  migration!

49030551,GERMAN MIGRATION,"  GERMAN  MIGRATION  A  chronic  difficulty  in  Aus  tralia's  immigration  and  de  velopment  programme  has  been  to  obtain  a  sufficient  pro  portion  of  skilled  agricultural  workers.  This  is  an  import  ant  factor  to  be  reckoned  with  in  the  urgent  and  complex  problem  of  revitalising  food  production.  Even  if  Britain  were  not  herself  engaged  in  a  vigorous  drive  for  more  out  put  from  the  land,  the  com  petition  from  other  overseas  countries  is  such  that  Austra  lia  would  still  have  to  turn  to  Europe  for  agricultural  mi  grants.  There,  too,  post-war  rehabilitation  has  reduced  the  small  proportion  which  farm  workers  represent  in  the  pool  of  potential  migrants.  But  there  is  a  surplus  of  landless  farming  people  in  West  Germany  for  special  rea  sons  emphasised  by  the  mem  bers  of  the  West  German  Federal  Migration  Board  now  visiting  Western  Australia  on  an  exploratory  mission.  The  Commonwealth  Govern  ment's  move  towards  accept  ance  of  a  quota  of  selec  ted  Germans  under  a  negotia  ted  migration  agreement  like  that  with  Italy-gives  Australia  a  chance  to  recruit  agricultural  workers.  For  West  Germany  it  offers  some  relief  in  the  problem  of  pro  viding  for  an  influx  of  nearly  10,000,000  people  who  are  either  victims  of  Communist  expulsion  from  the  Russian  dominated  territories  or  fugi  tives  from  Communist  terror.  Nothing  but  prejudice  need  stand  in  the  way  of  working  out  an  arrangement  for  mutual  advantage.  If  we  have  to  go  outside  Britain  for  population  we  naturally  look  first  along  the  Western  European  seaboard  for  assimilable  racial  stock  most  akin  to  our  own.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  war  there  have  been  great  changes  in  Germany  and  also  in  the  Western  attitude  to  the  Ger  man  people  and  their  future  in  the  free  world.  An  at  tempt  is  being  made  to  build  up  a  friendly  and  peaceful  cooperation  and,  at  the  same  time,  circumstances  have  pro  duced  a  new  period  of  Ger  man  readiness  to  migrate.  In  South  Australia,  particularly,  there  is  experience  of  how  an  earlier  generation  of  German  settlers  showed  a  capacity  to  identify  themselves  with  the  life  and  institutions  of  their  adopted  country.  Any  German  migration  now  could  amount  to  only  a  micro  scopic  percentage  of  the  Australian  population  and,  should  any  political  or  other  undesirables  slip  through  the  screen,  they  could  always  be  sent  back  on  proof  of  subversion  or  misconduct.  There  would  be  no  need  for  costly  land  settlement  ven  tures.  Concentration  on  Ger  man  farmers  or  farm-workers  willing  to  take  agricultural  jobs-perhaps  under  some  limited  contract-would  im  pose  a  minimum  strain  on  housing.

50207781,GERMAN PROBLEMS,"  GERMAN  PROBLEMS   Despite  the  grant  of  wide  self-governing  powers  and  economic  aid  to  Western  Ger  many,  it  is  doubtless  too  much   to  expect  that  relations  be  tween  this  and  other  Euro  jpean  States  should  be  con  sistently  harmonious.  British  policy  and  British  actions  have  I  often  been  unjustly  criticised  by  the  Adenauer  Government.  Upon  Britain  has  fallen  the  brunt  of  the  attack  relating  to  the  Allied  policy  of  disman  tling  certain  German  indus  tries.  Most  of  the  industrial  plants  marked  for  demolition  were  in  the  British-controlled  zone;  and,  as  fresh  cases  of  violence  this  week  have  I  shown,  German  workers  threatened  .  with  unemploy  iment  are  inclined  to  ascribe  I  their  troubles  to  those  near  at  hand.  |j  In  the  matter  of  disman  tling,  however.  Western  Ger  Ijmany  has  not  been  treated  liwith  undue  severity  by  the  II  Allies.  In  the  past  year,  de   molitions  of  major  plants  have!  seen  curtailed.  Some  observers.!  indeed,  feel  misgivings  overj  :he  decision  to  raise  the  an  nual  ceiling  for  German  steelj  production  to  eleven  million  |  :ons.  Such  unemployment!  roubles  as  face  the  Adenauer  Government,  are  due  chiefly  :o  the  waves  of  refugees  trom  :he  cast.  Latest  official  figures  show  that  there  are  now  8,500,000  registered  (and  many  unregistered)  refugees'  in  Western  Germany,  com  pared  with  1,558,469  unem-j  ployed.  Density  of  popula-l  tion  in  the  State  having  been  increased  by  30  per  cent.,  in-i  iustry  simply  cannot  absorb!  the  labor  available.  I  Even  so,  conditions  in  Western  Germany  have  enor  mously  improved  through  the  help  of  Marshall  Aid;  and  it  is  hardly  surprising  that,  apart  from  dismantling,  there  is  now  'little  sign  of  popular  disaffection,'  but  rather  a,  feeling  that  life  is  'returning!  to  normal.'  This  internal  pro  gress  seems  to  have  raised  hopes  that  the  country  can  achieve  greater  equality  with  her  neighbors,  and  perhaps  strengthen  herself  against  threats  from  the  east.  Dr.  Adenauer,  with  his  long  ex  perience  as  administrator  of  Cologne,  has  actively  en  couraged  the  idea  of  closer  German  collaboration  with  the  French.  In  view  of  the  re  cent  clash  over  the  Saar  coal  mines,  and  the  difficulties  met  in  drafting  a  trade  agreement,  however,  it  seems  scarcely  timely  for  Dr.  Adenauer  to  propose  a  Franco-German  union.",1950-03-10T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/50207781,"Despite the grant of wide self-governing powers and economic and to Western Germany, it is doubtless too much",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50207781?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1950-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1954-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1931 - 1954)",135.35235595703125,very relevant

261381597,GERMAN “PROPOSALS.”,"  GERMAN  “PROPOSALS.”   rgnHE  West  German  Chancellor  has  JiL.  been  vocal  again,  not  without  some  effect.  The  world’s  press  has  given,  over  much  space  to  comment  on  Dr.  Adenauer’s  plea  that  Ger  many  should  be  strengthened  again  to  serve  as  a  buffer  between  the  West  and  Russia.  Somewhat  less  space  to  these  important  matters  has  been  given  in  the  Australian  news  papers  where  pre-occupation  with  other  issues  has  crowded  the  German  news  out.  The  impudence  of  German  “statesmen,”  boundless  as  always,  permitted  Adenauer  to  insinuate  into  his  plea  the  suggestion  that  a  re  established  Germany  could  “avert  an  otherwise  inevitable  explosion.”  It  is  good  to  see  that  for  the  most  part  Adenauer’s  proposals  have  been  re  jected  with  contumely.  The  Christian  Science  Monitor  said  that  to  rearm  Germany  would  simply  place  in  Ger  man  hands  the  balance  of  power  in  Europe,  an  arrangement  which  might  suit  diabolical  German  plans  very  well,  but  which  would  effectively  destroy  any  prospect  of  world  peace.  The  warnings  against  these  German  manoeuvres  must  be  sounded  from  one  end  of  the  world  to  the  other.

The  resounding  defeat  of  both  Communist  and  Neo-Nazi  forces  in  open  election  may  mean  noth  ing  more  than  a  distrust  of  extremism  at  this  stage  of  national  resurgence.   .  It  may  also  mean  a  more  deepseated  opposition  to  dictatorship  and  all  its  works  born  of  the  ex  perience  of  past  decades.

49219179,GERMAN MIGRANTS,"  GERMAN  MIGRANTS  A  large  party  of  German  migrants  has  arrived  in  West  ern  Australia  and  its  members  are  bound  to  be  wondering  what  kind  of  reception  they  will  be  given  in  this  large  and  remote  part  of  the  Bri  tish  Commonwealth.  And  although  West  Australians  have  become  accustomed  to  European  migration,  doubt  less  many  of  them  will  be  a  little  curious  about  these  new  Australians  whose  homeland  has  altered  the  course  of  world  history  and  may  do  so  again.  There  need  be  no  misunder  standings.  Australia  is  not  exactly  an  earthly  paradise  but  the  Germans  who  have  come  to  our  shores  are  fortunate  people  and  we,  in  turn,  should  be  glad  to-have  them.  We  can  afford  to  forget  past  animosi  ties  and  Hitler's  misdeeds  but,  if  we  cannot  completely  .erase  them,  we  should  take  a  broad  view  of  history  and  recollect  that  Wellington  prayed  for  Blucher's  arrival  at  Waterloo.  Australia,  after  all,  is  not  so  remote  from  the  world's  great  populations  and  if  it  is  to  accept  the  challenge  of  the  new  Asia  it  will  have  need  for  the  German  qualities  of  indus  try,  fortitude  and  discipline.

49267736,EAST GERMAN,"  EAST  GERMAN   HATRED  OF  REDS.   Berlin,  Wednesday:  Russian  tanks  patroled  East  Berlin  tonight,  restoring  order  after  the  two-day  riots,  which  cost  four  lives  and  left  60  people  injured.   Unrest  has  spread  to  other  East  German  cities  -^Magdeburg,  Halie,  Erfurt,  and  Leipzig-where  discontent  pt  the  actions  of  the  Communist  Govern-  ment  is  growing.   Soviet  tanks  tonight  had  sealed  all  the  main  ap-  proaches  to  East  Berlin  from  .the  West.   Five  tanks,  their  guns  pointin»  toward  West  Ber-  lin,  took  up  positions  in  Un-  ter  Den  Linden,  to  reinforce  lorry  loads  of  steel-helmeted  machine-gunners.  *   Two  anti-tank  guns  were  also  deployed  in  Unter  Den  Linden,  facing  the  British  sector  through  the  Bran-  denburg  gate.   Battalions  of  East.  Ger-  many's  barracked  police  force,  which  is  trained  and  equipped  like  an  army,  guarded  the  entrances  to  East  'Berlin  and  barred  everyone  without  an  East  Berlin  I  identity  card.   Two  of  the  four  dead  in  the  riots  were  run  over  .  by  Soviet  tanks.   A  21-years-old  man,  shot  in  front  of  an  East  German  Government  building  died  in  the  West  Berlin  Hospital.  The  fourth  man.  killed  was  a   West*  Berliner,  who  was  shot   in  the  head.   Earlier  some  40,000  angry  East  Berlin  workers  .hurling  stones,  smashing  windows,  starting  fires  and  yelling  dé  nuhciatfons  bf  the  East  Ger-  man  Communist  Leaders  marched  through  the  streets.  They  demonstrated  in  front  of  the  Government  buildings  and  party  headquarters  and  outside  the  prisons,  calling  for  the  release  of  political  prisoners.   All  German  Affair   It  had  become  an  all-Ger-  man  affair  throughout  yes-  terday,  when  the  strikers  ,  forced  the  East  German   ¡Government  to  withdraw  an  .  iprder-  to  do  more  work  for   Çkie  same  pay.  After  this  Victory  the  temper  and  size  .of  the  demonstration  grew.   It  was  directed  against  the  East  German  Govern-  ment  and,  on  the  advice  -of  ¿he  workers*  leaders,  avoided  any  attack  on  the  Soviet  jragime.   Soviet  soldiers  at  first  stood  by,  but  the  East  Ger-  man  police  were  powerless.  (Twenty  police  were  tramp-  led  down,  in  Unter  Den  Linden.   Then  thc  Russians  has-  tily  dug  in  round  the  Go-  vernment  quarter  and  or-  dered  tanks  and  armored  cars  into  action.

225901455,GERMAN MENACE,"  GERMAN  MENACE   'THE  likelihood  of  West  Germany  receiving  her.  1  sovereignty  and  the  right  to  rearm  if  France  fails  to  ratify  the  European  Defence  Community  Treaty  must  be  as  alarming  to  Russia  as  it  is  to  France.   Both  nations  have  good  reason  to  fear  a  resur  gence  of  German  militarism.  France  has  been  over  run  by  the  Germans  three  times  in  less  than  90  years,  and  in  the  last  world  war  Germany  nearly  defeated  Russia.  while  fighting  half  the  rest  of  the  world.  -  The  Germans  laid  waste  European  Russia,  killed  about  10,000,000  Russian  soldiers  and  about  20,000,000  civilians  and  reduced  Soviet  industrial  production  by  nearly  half.  So  it  is  easy  to  under  stand  why  it  became  a  basic  aim  of  Russian  policy,  as  soon  as  victory  began  to  emerge,  to  see  that  de  feated  Germany  was  not  left  to  herself  or  driven  into  the  arms  of  an  anti-Communist  Western  alliance.  The  Russian  rulers  have  made  a  sorry  mess  of  their  efforts  to  achieve  these  aims.  In  less  than  a  decade  the  probability  has  arisen  of  a  sovereign  Germany  becoming  a  member  of  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organisation  and  a  full  ally  of  the  West.  Reports  of  the  revival  of  Nazism  in  high  places  in  West  Germany  are  among  the  reasons  why  the  West  as  well  as  Russia  should  feel  far  from  happy  about  this  probability.  Russia  has  proposed  another  meeting  to  dis-   cuss  European  security  and  the  future  of  Germany.  Britain  and  America  are  said  to  favour  rejection  of  this  proposal,  but  the  French  Premier  (M.  Mendes-France)  is  understood  to  wish  the  door,  to  be  kept  open.  While  the  history  of  East-West  con  ferences  does  not  encourage  hope  that  anything  use  ful  would  come  of  such  a  conference,  it  is  possible  that  Russia  is  now  so  deeply  perturbed  about  the""  likelihood  of  a  rearmed  sovereign  Germany  that  she  would  at  last  be  prepared  to'  offer  genuine  co  operation  in  an  attempt  to  remove  the  dangers  her  foolish  policies  have  done  so  much  to  create.  :je  '  ,  #  sk  Pifrxr  fvancnnrf  Tle  Plan  for  the  trans-  fer  of  the  Hobart  public  transport  system  from  the  ownership  and  control  of  the  Hobart  City  Council  to  a  Government  trust  seems  to  be  well  on  the  way  to  realisation.  Some  time  ago  the  Government  intimated  that  it  would  be  willing  to  discuss  taking  over  the  Laun-  cestori  transport  system  as  well  as  that  of  Hobart,  but  the  Launceston  City  Council  decided,  wisely  no  doubt,  to  wait  a  while  and  see  what  happened  in  Hobart.  The  Hobart  plan  is  now  sufficiently  .well  defined  to  provide  a  basis  for  preliminary  investi  gation  and  discussion  by  Launceston.  Launceston  has  a  transport  rate  of  lid.  which  could  be  abolished  if  the  Government  became  re  sponsible  for  the  losses.  There  have  been  country  objections  to  the  idea  of  city  transport  losses  being  met  from  state  revenue,  but  it  is  likely  that  this  opposition  will  be  disposed  of  in  Parliament  by  an  assurance  that  the  money  will  not  come  out  of  the  pockets  of  Tasmanian  taxpayers  but  from  an  addi  tion  to  the  annual  special  Commonwealth  grant.  The  ""Grants  Commission  is  understood  to  have  adopted,  in  relation  to  South  Australia,  a  principle  which  assures  Tasmania  of  this  additional  assis  tance.  However,  there  are  other  aspects  requiring  careful  consideration.

There  have  been  many  books  on  Germany  and  the  Germans,  but  few  have  had  the  sensitivity  and  penetreating  insight  of'  ""Hans.""   It  is  a  long  short  story  rather  than  a  novel,  and  it  deals  with  one  German,  Hans  Bernhard,  formerly  conductor  at  the  Frankfurt  Opera  House.  As  a  prisoner  of  war  Hans  decides  to  accept  work  on  a  French  farm.  Here  he  comes  under  the  influence  of  Madame  Rose  and  her  son  Louis,  who  has  been  maimed  and  tortured  by  the  Germans  while  fighting  as  a  maquis.  Louis  hates  Hans  with  a  downright,  peasant  hatred.  Hans  regards  Louis  as  a  terrorist  who  has  received  his  just  deserts.  Madame  Rose,  with  simple  kindli  ness,  tries  to  reconcile  the  two,  and  bring  some  relief  to  Hans'  tortured  mind.  For  the  German  is   racked  by  conflicting  emotions.  While  not  a  Nazi,  he  is  one  of  those  willing  millions  of  Ger  mans  who  made  Nazism  possible.  While  conscious  of  Ger  many's  guilt,  he  cannot  rid  himself  of  his  master  race  complex.

140853204,GERMAN ATTITUDE,"  GERMAN  ATTITUDE   Just  a  brief  word  on  the  attitude  of  the  German  mili  tary  caste  towards  war.  Colo  nel  H.  Foertsch  in  his  book   The  Art  of  War—  Today  and  Tomorrow,'  wrote  (a  fairly  liberal  translation)  'All  life  is  a  struggle.  The  strong  shall  conquer  live  and  reproduce,  the  weak,  however,  will  suc  cumb,  die  and  not  return.  ;  Eternal  peace  is  a  dream  and  never  a  beautiful  one  —  war,  however,  is  a  part  of  God's  world  order.  Only  the  weak  need  fear  war,  the  strong  have  no  fear,  by  the  mere  fact  that  they  are  strong.  To  ex  perience  war—  in  the  deepest  sense  of  this  much  used  word  —  is  a  joy  and  a  pleasure.'  The  changing  attitude  of  the  Germans  as  the  war  progress  ed  was  clearly  noticeable  —  I  exclude,  of  course,  the  SS  and  the  Gestapo  —  and  their  fear  of  the  Russians  was  most  pronounced.  It  is  hard  to  say  to  what  extent  they  were  be  hind  the  Hitler  regime  —  the  majority  were,  of  course,  de  laying  that  they  were  ever  good  Nazis  at  the  war's  end.  But  I  strongly  suspect  that  they  were  reasonably  ardent  supporters  of  the  regime  af  ter  the  earlier  victories  of  1940.  With  most  people,  after  all,  results  alone  count.  At  least  one  German  of  my  ac  quaintance,  was  pessimistic  enough  to  sing  in  the  compa  rative  safety  of  our  .barrack  washroom  'Deutschland  ist  kaput'  in  early  1944.  On  the  whole  the  Luftwaffe  treatoi  us  fairly  and  adhered  to  the  Geneva  Convention.  The  two  air  forces  had  a  mutual  re  spect  for  each  other  and  the  average  German  civilian,  at  least  in  the  country  centres,  was  not  as  antagonistic  to   wards  air  crew,  particularly  bomber  command,  as  we  might  have  expected.  It  was  a  different  story  in  the  larger  cities,  especially  the  target  area,  but  that  is  understan  dable.  To  conclude  I  would  like  to  quote^rom  Winston  Church  ill's  book,  'My  Early  Life.'  'Prisoner  of  War—  that  is  the  least  unfortunate  kind  of  prisoner  to  be,  but  it  is  ne  vertheless  a  melancholy  state.  You  are  in  the  power  of  your  enemy.  You  owe  your  life  to  his  humanity  and  your  daily  bread  to  '  his  compassion.  You  must  obey  his  orders,  go  where  he  tells  you,  stay  where  you  are  bid,  await  his  plea  sure,  possess  your  soul  in  pa  tience.  Meanwhile,  the  war  is  going  on,  great  events  are  in   progress,  fine  opportunities  for  action  and  adventure  are  slipping  away.  Also,  the  days  are  very  long.  Hours  crawl  like  paralytic  centipedes.  No  thing  amuses  you.  Reading  is  difficult;  writing  impossible.  Life  is  one  long  boredom  from  ('awn  till  slumber.  Moreover,  the  whole  atmosphere  of  pri  son,  even  the  most  easy  and  best  regulated  prison,  is  od  ious.  Companions  in  this  kind  of  misfortune  quarrel  about  trifles  and  get  the  least  pos  sible  pleasure  from  each  oth  er's  society.  If  you  have  never  been  under  restraint  before  and  never  known  what  it  is  to  be  a  captive,  you  feel  a  sense  of  constant  humiliation  in  being  confined  to  a  narrow  space,  fenced  in  by  wire,  wat  ched  ,by  armed'men  and  web  bed  in  by  a  tangle  of  regula  tions.  I  certainly  hated  every  minute  of  my  captivity  more  than  I  hated  any  other  period  in  my  whole  life  .  .  .  looking  back  on  those  days  I  have  al  ways  felt  the  keenest  pity  for  prisoners  and  captives.'  -",1952-07-19T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/140853204,Just a brief word on the attitude of the German military caste towards war.

The  ABC  news  session  on  Wednesday]  morning  reported  Mr.  Holt  as  stating  that  he  examined  the  screening  system  in  Germany  and  he  was  very  happy  with  it,  it  was  function  ing  perfectly.  He  had  seen  the  files  on  Nazis  and  their  completeness  astonished  him.   Mr.  Holt  did  not  state  whether  the  screening  of  migrants  was  based  on  the  weeding  out  of  Nazis*  or  other  people.  It  is  one  thing  to  have  the  files,  another  to  use  them  against  Nazis.   However,  he  went  on  to  say,  or  is  reported  as  having  done  so,  that  the  Dutch  would  make  the  more  desirable  migrants.   Why,  then,  is  he  allocating  first  place  to  Germans?  The  filing  system  he  praised  so  highly  would  surely  list  only  the  outstanding  workers  for  Nazism*  the  gauleiters  and  the  smaller  fry  who  bossed  the  towns  and  villages.   This  filing  system  surely  did  not  list  all  those  Noting  people  who  had  been  taken  by  the  Nazis  and  moulded  to  Nazi  doctrine  during  their  most  impressionable  years...  people  who  are  now  of  the  eligible  age  group  to  come  here.   Nor  would  any  screening  system,  however  efficient,  be  able  to  cope  thoroughly  with  so  many  applications  that  would  involve  the  acceptance  of  ten  thousand  a  year,  and  at  least  a  token  rejection  of  a  few  besides.   What  will  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  do  now,  to  acquaint  the  general  community  with  the  dangers  involved,  and  the  need  for  constant  vigilance  if  the  demo  cratic  institutions  We  have  evolved  out  of  much  tribulation  are  to  be  transmitted  to  our  successor  generations?",1952-09-05T00:00:00Z,Article,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/261411113,Percipient members of the Australian Jewish community were not surprised by the statements in the press that the Minister for Migration (Mr. Holt) had signed an agreement with the West German Government for the mass migration,https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article261411113?searchTerm=german+date%3A%5B1950-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1954-12-31T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D,"The Sydney Jewish News (Sydney, N.S.W : 1939 - 1954)",135.28274536132812,very relevant
