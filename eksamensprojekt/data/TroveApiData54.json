                        "articleText": "<p><span>  GERMAN  SPEEADEAGLEISM.</span></p> <p><span>  A  prominent  German  newspaper  baa</span><span>  opened  oat  with,  another  hysterical</span><span>  tirade  against  Great  Britain.  This  in</span><span>  stance  of  spread-eagleism  might  well</span><span>  be  dismissed,  as  others  have  been,  but</span><span>  that  it  acquires  special  significance</span></p> <p><span>  from  tbe  fact  that  the  journal  in</span><span>  which  it  appears  is  frequently  the</span><span>  mouthpiece  of  the  Government  —  which</span><span>  in  international  affairs  really  means</span><span>  the  impetuous,  ambitious  Kaiser  —  and</span><span>  touches  upon  tbe  vital  question  of  what</span><span>  Power  really  controls  the  destiny  of</span><span>  European  politics.  Great  Britain  is</span><span>  warned  not  to  provoke  a  decision  on</span><span>  the  subject,  because  of  the  world</span><span>  wide  significance  and  effect  attaching</span><span>  to  it.  In  other  words  Germany  infer</span><span>  entially  threatens  that  if  the  issue  is</span></p> <p><span>  provoked  Bhe  will  contest  any  decision</span><span>  adverse  to  her  aspirations  in  that  con</span><span>  nection.  Tbe  greatest  of  the  Kaiser's</span><span>  many  ambitions  is  unquestionably  that</span><span>  Germany  should  gain  that  indefinite,</span><span>  yet  all  important,  quality  known  as</span><span>  the  '  balance  of  power.'  Every  move</span><span>  in  policy,  every  increase  of  the  navy</span><span>  and  the  army  is  conceived  with  that</span><span>  objective  in  view;  it  is  almost,  if  not</span><span>  quite,  an  obsession  with  the  Monarch.</span><span>  How  far  this  spirit  and  the  prepara</span><span>  tions  which  How  from  it  can  ba  effec</span></p> <p><span>  tive,  must  remain  iu  uuuoi  uum  ??</span><span>  test  has  been  applied.  In  tbe  interim</span><span>  Germany  remains  the  cause  of  unrest</span><span>  amongst  the  nations,  and  because</span><span>  of  her  strenuousnesss  in  almost</span><span>  every  part  of  the  world  has</span><span>  to  be  closely  watched,  even  by</span><span>  the  smaller  powers.  It  can  well  be</span><span>  understood  that  a  nation  with  such</span><span>  ambitions  as  Germany  has  chafes</span><span>  under  the  '  diplomatic  net  '  which</span><span>  has  been  woven  around  her,  and  for</span><span>  which  Great  Britain  has  to  thank  the</span><span>  late  Lord  Salisbury,  whose  apprecia</span><span>  tion  of  the  importance  of  the  Empire's</span><span>  relations  with  the  other  Powers  has</span><span>  resulted  in  the  creation  of  what  is  ad</span><span>  mitted  to  be  the  ablest  diplomatic</span><span>  service  in  the  world.  That  service</span><span>  has  unquestionably  checkmated  Ger</span><span>  many,  maintained  Great  Britain's</span></p> <p><span>  prestige  and,  by  .the  intervening  of</span><span>  interests,  made  her  position  more</span><span>  secure  and  yet  left  an  outlet  for.  the</span><span>  policy  of  'grand  isolation'  which</span><span>  Lord  Salisbury  considered  so  essential</span><span>  to  her  supremacy.  Germany  may  at</span><span>  tempt  to  capture  the  '  balance  of</span><span>  power  '  by  a  revolt  against  the  tight</span><span>  ening  cordon  of  diplomacy,  tbe  con</span><span>  tinued  increase  -of  her  naval  and  mer</span><span>  cantile  fleets,  and  her  army.  Bat</span><span>  how  long  could  such  an  aggressive</span><span>  nation,  inclined  to  riding  rough-shod</span><span>  over  obstacles,  maintain  that  power</span><span>  when  in  the  high  stirrups,  assuming</span><span>  that  altitude  was  attained  9  Not  for</span><span>  long,  we  believe.  So  long  as  Great</span></p> <p><span>  Britain  maintains  the  two-power  de</span><span>  fence,  the  balance  of  power  is  likely  to</span><span>  remain  with  her.  But  at  Germany's</span><span>  rate  of  battleship  construction  that</span><span>  position  is  being  jeopardised.  It  is</span><span>  probably  Great  Britain's  realisation  of</span><span>  that  fact  which  the  German  semi</span><span>  official  newspaper  regards  as  provoca</span><span>  tion  for  testing  the  issue  of  supre</span><span>  macy,  and  for  the  spreadeaglelsm  in</span><span>  which  it  indulges  with  reference  to  tbe</span><span>  capabilities  of  the  army.  Though</span><span>  hysterical,  however,  the  declaration,</span><span>  emanating  from  what  is  frequently</span><span>  the  mouth-piece  of  the  Government,</span><span>  may  or  may  not  have  official  founda</span><span>  tion  ;  at  any  rate  it  is  worth  noticing.</span></p> "

Compared  with  1906,  all  sources  of</span><span>  revenue,  except  two  show  increases,  as,  for  instance,</span><span>  Customs  duties,  643,000,000  marks,  or  88,400,000  marks</span><span>  more  than  during  the  previous  year.  Tobacco  and  cigar-</span></p> <p><span>  ettes  excise  duties  23,600,000  marks,  or  7,000,000  marks</span><span>  more,  distilled  excise  duties  112,600,000  marks,  or</span><span>  7,800,000  marks  more,  brewing  excise  duties  51,100,000</span><span>  marks,  or  8,200,000  marks  more,  etc.  The  two  excep-</span><span>  tions  referred  to  are  the  stamp  duties  on  revenue-pro-</span><span>  ducing  stocks  and  on  Bourse  transactions,  which  together</span></p> <p><span>  yielded  22,900,000  marks  less  than  in  1906.  But  against</span><span>  this  it  should  be  remembered  that  they  had  been  un-</span><span>  naturally  high  during  that  year.  All  other  sources</span><span>  of  revenue  together  show  an  increase  of  160,000,000</span><span>  marks  in  round  figures,  so  that  if  we  deduct  the  lesser</span><span>  yield  of  the  Bourse  transactions,  there  still  remains  for</span><span>  1907  an  excess  of  revenue  of  137,000,000  marks  in  round</span><span>  figures  as  compared  to  the  previous  year.  Moreover,</span><span>  the  fact  should  not  be  lost  sight  of  that  of  the  new</span><span>  duties  passed  in  1906,  obviously  none  were  able  to</span><span>  yield  their  full  measure  of  revenue  in  1907.  This  will</span><span>  only  be  the  case  in  1910,  and  not  before.  This  much,</span><span>  however,  may  safely  be  predicted—that  the  expecta-</span><span>  tions  which  led  to  the  imposition  of  the  new  duties</span><span>  will  be  fully  justified;  in  fact,  in  some  instances,  the</span><span>  yield  has  already  come  up  to  the  estimates.</span></p> "

He</span><span>  says  :  'j[  believe  an  extraordinary  situa</span><span>  tion  ihas  been  created,  and  that  hence</span><span>  forward,  if  Germany  so  will  and  can</span><span>  find  the  money,  the  two-Power  '  stand</span><span>  ard  of  the  Britisk  Fleet,  accepted  by</span><span>  Liverals  as  well  as  Conservatives,  can</span><span>  not  be  maintained.  .  -  Few  persons</span><span>  realise  what  the  appearance  of  such  a</span><span>  navy  as  that  which  Germany  is  build</span><span>  ing  means  in  international  affairs.

The  question  is:  What</span><span>  will  she  be  able  to  do  with  such  a</span><span>  force?  That  is  her  meaning:  the</span><span>  expediency  of  an  unknown  future,  as</span><span>  yet  contingent,  and  impossible  to  fore</span><span>  see.

In  'The  United  Service</span><span>  Gazette'  Captain  E.  H.

I  heard  the  German</span><span>  people  talking  peace  a  month  after</span><span>  the  outbreak  of  war—of  a  peace</span></p> <p><span>  to  be  sure  which  Germany  would</span><span>  dictate  and  keep.  When  the</span><span>  Fatherland  was  winning  I  heard  no</span><span>  discordant  note.

The</span><span>  great  captains  of  industry  who  con-</span><span>  trol  the  party  believe  in  the  em-</span><span>  ployment  of  the  German  Army  and</span><span>  Navy  to  further  their  ends  —  i.e.,  to</span><span>  secure  permanently  for  Germany</span></p> <p><span>  the  mining  regions  of  Northern</span><span>  France  and  the  coal  and  shipping</span><span>  of  Belgium  ;  and  to  cripple  rival</span><span>  commerce,  not  only  as  a  means  of</span><span>  winning  the  war,  but  also  of  limit-</span><span>  ing  competition  against  them  after</span><span>  wards.  These  are  the  men  behind</span><span>  Tirpitz,  and  they  are  working,  and</span><span>  will  continue  to  work,  to  restore</span><span>  him  to  power.</span><span>  Dr  Stresemann,  one  of  the  most</span><span>  influential  National  Liberals,  is  a</span><span>  dynamo  of  energy  in  German  com-</span><span>  mercial  plans.  His  eyes  sparkling</span><span>  with  zeal,  reddish  hair,  a  clear,</span><span>  metallic  voice,  he  is  a  heavy  man</span><span>  physically,  wielding  a  tremendous</span><span>  and  growing  power  in  Germany  to-</span><span>  day.  He  has  a  controlling  interest</span><span>  in  a  recently  organised  combination</span><span>  of  some  two  thousand  manufactur-</span><span>  ing  firms,  and  is  practically  dictator</span><span>  of  the  Sachsische  Handelsgesell-</span><span>  schaft  and  the  Deutsch-Amerikan-</span><span>  ische  Wirthschaftsverband.</span><span>  He  became  one  of  theChancellor's</span><span>  most  out-spoken  enemies  at  the</span></p> <p><span>  time  of  the  Danish  concessions  to</span><span>  America,  and  his  fiery  advocacy  of</span><span>  relentless  submarine  warfare  has</span><span>  earned  him  a  reputation  for  fright-</span><span>  fulness,  even  in  Germany.  He  be-</span><span>  longs  to  the  Western  School  of  pre-</span><span>  sent-day  Germany  —  the  school</span><span>  which  believes  in  placating  Russia</span><span>  (to  be  followed  by  a  peaceful  pene-</span><span>  tration  of  that  country)  and  the</span><span>  smashing  as  far  as  possible  of</span><span>  Britain  and  France.  As  his  utter-</span><span>  ances  in  the  Reichstag  plainly  show,</span><span>  he  is  passionately  anti-American  in</span><span>  general  and  anti-Wilson  in  par-</span><span>  ticular.</span><span>  Since  he  is  one  of  the  foremost</span><span>  Germans  in  the  great  campaign</span><span>  against  Great  Britain  both  during</span><span>  and  after  the  war,  Dr  Stresemann's</span><span>  views  should  be  of  particular  in-</span><span>  terest.  His  most  recent  utterances</span><span>  agree  in  the  main  with  those  he</span><span>  made  in  an  interview  which  he  gave</span><span>  me,  and  which  I  duly  communi-</span><span>  cated  to  American  newspapers</span><span>  through  the  Wilhelmstrasse.  There</span><span>  are,  however,  some  important  dif-</span><span>  ferences  which  I  shall  point  out</span></p> <p><span>  later.</span><span>  \"How  seriously  do  German  in-</span><span>  dustrial  circles  regard  the  Paris</span><span>  Economic  Conference?\"  was  the</span><span>  first  question  I  put  to  Dr  Strese-</span><span>  mann.</span><span>  \"If  one  is  to  attach  great  import-</span><span>  ance  to  the  words  of  the  political</span><span>  economists  of  the  Entente,\"  he  be-</span><span>  gan,  \"then  we  must  agree  that  we</span><span>  might  have  considerable  anxiety</span><span>  and  alarm  about  our  industrial  fut-</span><span>  ure;  but,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  Ger-</span><span>  man  industrial  circles  view  these</span><span>  endeavors  of  our  enemies  with  calm-</span><span>  ness  of  indifference.</span><span>  \"Russia  cannot  emancipate  her-</span><span>  self  from  German  industry.

Had</span><span>  there  never  been  a  great  Empire  of  Germany,</span><span>  then  possibly  there  would  now  be  a</span><span>  great  German  Empire.  We  want  to  realise</span><span>  that  the  old  German  Empire  was  one</span><span>  made  up  of  nations,  and  that  some  of</span><span>  these  did  great  pioneerlng  work  which</span><span>  circumstances  linked  with  their  individual</span><span>  selves.  If  Australia  were  to  take  all</span><span>  New  Guinea,  and  England  approved,  it</span><span>  would  be  an  Imperial  work,  and  our  language</span><span>  being  the  same,  the  latter  would</span><span>  stand  even  though  ultimately  we  separated.</span><span>  Some  of  the  work  of  Spain  was  done</span><span>  as  part  of  the  old  German  Empire:  that</span><span>  is  to  say,  the  King  of  Spain  was  also  the</span><span>  German  Emperor.  The  old  German  Empire</span><span>  came  too  soon  in  last,  albeit  it  did  last</span></p> <p><span>  in  one  form  and  another  for  ages.  Permanent</span><span>  Empire  is  dependent  on  rapid</span><span>  transit  and  quick  intercommunications.</span><span>  Without  the  stcemboat  and  the  telegraph,</span><span>  and  also  railways  in  conjunction,  the  present</span><span>  British  Empire  would  be  as  impossible</span><span>  as  was  the  former  one.  1t  is  forgotten</span><span>  that  there  was  an  Anglo-French</span><span>  Empire,  even  though  not  that  the  thirteen</span><span>  American  Colonies  dissolved,  the</span><span>  Anglo-American  one  to  the  extent  that</span><span>  they  were  responsible  for  the  title.  German</span><span>  is  the  vernacular  of  a  territorially</span><span>  small  section  of  the  world's  surface.  It</span><span>  is  filled  in  solid  in  the  little  map.  German</span><span>  is  read  or  spoken  to  some  extent  in</span><span>  the  shaded  sections,  for  the  following  reasons—</span><span>  in  parts  through  old  control  and</span><span>  the  continued  virility  and  influence  of  the</span><span>  strain,  and  over  all  through  present  Germany's</span><span>  commercial  and  flinancial  relatlonships.</span><span>  To  these  we  may  add  strain  derivations,</span><span>  no  matter  of  what  date,  and  the</span><span>  face  that  German  has  been  responsible</span><span>  for  a  great  literature.  Nevertheless  partial</span><span>  use  is  not  sufficient.  Partial  use</span><span>  in  Germany's  case  means  that  in  many</span><span>  spheres  the  language  is  merely  classical.</span><span>  There  is  no  domain  for  the  vernacular  to</span><span>  establish  itself  outside  of  Europe  and</span><span>  spread.</span></p> "

It</span><span>  is  hardly  likely,  of  cource,  that  there</span><span>  will  be  any  immediate  change  of  Gcr.</span><span>  man  Dolicy.  Even  the  supporters  of  the</span><span>  now  President,  Jubilant  as  they  must</span><span>  be,  would  not  dare  to  take  the  jisk  of</span><span>  provoking  civil  war.  At  the  same  time</span><span>  the  victory  of  HiIndenburg,  who  is  tihe</span><span>  figurehead  of  the  Monarchists,  is  sug</span><span>  gestive  of  the  growing  strength  of  that</span><span>  element  which  would  turn  thle  military</span><span>  defeat  of  the  Great  War  Into  a  diplo</span><span>  matic  success,  or  at  least  a  draw  with</span><span>  out  penalties.  There  was  a  time  when</span><span>  the  aged  marshal's  name  was  one  to</span><span>  conjure  with.,  iHe  was  the  Idol  of  a</span><span>  deluded  people,  but  when  the  \"im</span><span>  pregnable\"  imne  which  bore  his  name</span><span>  was  broken,  when  the  Australlans</span><span>  participated  in  the  smashing  blow</span><span>  that  crumpled  up  his  armies,  ficktle</span><span>  fame  deserted  him.  Since  then  he  Ilas</span><span>  tasted  the  sorrows  as  well  as  the</span><span>  sweets  of  public  eminence.  A  hero  and</span><span>  a  butt,  a  national  saviour  and  a  na</span></p> <p><span>  tional  scapegoat,  a  great  soldier  to</span><span>  whom  a  war  fired  people  paid  bound</span><span>  less  homage,.  and  a  reputed  failure</span><span>  bowed  down  beneath  popular  derision,</span><span>  all  these  vagaries  Von  Hindenburg  has</span><span>  experienced:  and  now  he  has  emerged</span><span>  from  obsburity  into  triumph.  He  has</span><span>  becomen  the  leader  of  tile  German  na</span><span>  tion  with.  power  to  mould  its  progress</span><span>  to  his  will.</span><span>  Through  all  the  conflict  of  opinion</span><span>  that  filters  through  the  calbles  it  is</span><span>  difficult  to  gauge  with  any  degree  of</span><span>  accuracy  the  trend  of  th'ought  in  Ger</span><span>  many.  Tile  statements  the  new  PrCs</span><span>  dent  has  m'ale  frops  time  to  tintme</span><span>  have  in  them  the  elements  of  confu</span><span>  sion;  but  it  seems  reasonably  certain</span><span>  that  the  nation  as  a  whole  is  by  no</span><span>  means  irrevocably  coninitted  to'  tile</span><span>  republican  form  of  government.  Nor  is</span><span>  there  .any  sound  ground  for  believing</span><span>  that  .the  nation  Is  prepared  tio  accept</span><span>  the  consequences  of  the  d~feat  of  her</span><span>  reckless  bid  for  world  power.  It  has</span><span>  been  well  sald  thatthere  is  no  sign  of</span><span>  'disarmament  of  the  intellect  in  Ger</span><span>  many,\"  and  the  Allied  Military  Mis</span><span>  sion  has  discovered  disturbing  signs</span><span>  of  purposeful  evasion  of  treaty  obliga</span><span>  tions.  The  same  spirit  has  been  en</span><span>  countered  in  other  directions.  The</span><span>  schemes  of  successive  governments  to</span><span>  outwit  theAllies  and  hscape  financial</span><span>  burdens  ruined  tile  countr.y's  .cur</span><span>  rency'and  shattered  its  credit.  Sonme</span><span>  months  ago  we  pointed  out  that  *  the</span><span>  trouble  seems  to  be  the  persistence  of</span><span>  tile  Prusslan  military  caste,  backed  by</span><span>  the  war  profiteers  and  imperiallaistic</span><span>  intellectuals.  German  democracy  is</span><span>  being  trampled  upon  by  thle  wcr  lords,</span><span>  and  there  is  little  prospect  of  real</span><span>  peace  until  the  yoke  of  the  Juinkers</span><span>  has  been  removed  front  their  necks.</span><span>  There  is  dome  consolation.  in  the</span><span>  knowledge  that  the  Republican  vote  is</span><span>  still  a  force  to  be  reckoned  with  in  tile</span><span>  constituencieo.  In  tfact  some  of  tihe</span><span>  election  figures  which  have  just  been</span><span>  published  suggest  that  there  are  more</span><span>  Republicans  thaAl  Monarchists.  and</span><span>  whether  their  preference  for  Dr.  Marx</span><span>  indicated  a  belief  that  the  Replublican</span><span>  form  of  gpvernment  was  the  ideal,  or</span><span>  merely  the  best  expedient  for  mollify</span><span>  ing  publlec  opinion  in  othler  countries,</span><span>  tile  result  is  much  thle  same.

A  crisis  has  now  been  reached  with  the  refusal  of  Germany,</span><span>  through  the  mouth  of  Dr.  Schacht  (president  of  the  Reichsbank),</span><span>  to  pay  interest  or  any  proportion  of  interest  upon  her  debts,  includ</span><span>  ing  the  Dawes  and  Young  loans.  This  step  amounts  to  repudiation.</span><span>  The  requests,  polite  enough  in  all  conscience,  of  the  British  and</span><span>  French  Governments  for  further  information  on  the  situation,  are</span><span>  declared  by  the  Nazi  organs  to  be.  'mere  bluff'  and  the  principal</span><span>  Nazi  newspaper  states  that,  should  England  take  any  active  steps</span><span>  against  Germany  in  regard  to  these  debts,  Germany  would  'retaliate</span><span>  against  the  whole  British  Empire  which  sells  considerably  more  to</span><span>  Germany  than  it  buys  from  her'.</span><span>  'Whilst  it  may  be  true  that  Germany  buys  more  from  the  British</span><span>  Empire  than  that  Empire  buys  from  her,  the  thought  might  occur</span><span>  even  to  the  Nazi  intelligence  that  it  is  no  benefit  to  sell  to  a  country</span><span>  which  does  not  pay.  It  is  better  to  be  without  the  business.</span><span>  .  Ever  since  the  AVar  period,  German  national  finance  has  been</span><span>  a  stumbling  block  to  Europe.  After  the  inflation  period  the  Dawes</span><span>  loan  was  floated,  for  the  purpose  of  putting  Germany  upon  her</span><span>  financial  feet  and  restoring  her  currency.  When  the  final  reparation</span><span>  settlement  was  arrived  at,  the  Young  loan  was  floated  to  assist  in  that</span><span>  settlement.  Germany  had  the  money  but  reparations  have  been  done</span><span>  away  with.  At  every  turn  Germany  has  scored,  and  she  proposed</span><span>  to  crown  her  victories  of  the  past  by  an  open  repudiation  of  her</span><span>  international  obligations.  It  may  or  it  may  not  be  surprising  that</span><span>  Nazi  finance  should  in  the  end  come  down  to  the  same  level  as  the</span><span>  finance  of  the  Bolshevists,  to  whom  the  Nazi  spirit  is  alleged  to  be</span><span>  so  opposed.</span><span>  The  affair  may  prove  to  be  a  further  lesson,  and  it  may  be</span><span>  hoped  a  lesson  which  will  sink  home,  to  those  who  for  so  long  have</span><span>  argued  that  the  reconstruction  of  world  trade  can  only  be,  or  chiefly</span><span>  be,  accomplished  by  the  financial  reconstruction  of  Europe.  Hun</span><span>  dreds  of  millions  of  pounds  have  been  lent  to  the  countries  of  Central</span><span>  Europe  for  reconstruction  purposes,  with  the  consequence  that,  with</span><span>  one  exception  (Czechoslovakia),  they  are  all  to-day  as  bankrupt  as</span><span>  they  ever  were.</span></p> "

Considering  the  circumstances  of  government  in</span><span>  Germany  to-day,  there  could  never  have  been  much  doubt  upon</span><span>  this  point,  because  it  is  an  acknowledged  rule  of  Nazidom,  expressed</span><span>  many  times  by  Herren  Hitler,  Goering  and  Goebbels,  that  there</span><span>  can  be  no  opposition,  no  other  way  of  thinking  in  Germany  to</span><span>  that  which  these  gentlemen  dictate.</span><span>  The  result  of  the  plebiscite  was  in  the  affirmative,  and  it  has</span><span>  even  been  described  as  a  victorious  result.  Upon  examining  the</span><span>  figures,  however,  it  is  quite  clear  that  the  Nazi  Government  is  by  no</span><span>  means  as  popular  as  might  appear  from  the  figures.  About  10  per</span><span>  cent,  of  the  population  had  the  courage  to  vote  'No,'  whilst  almost</span><span>  as  many  again  either  spoilt  their  ballot  papers  or  did  not  vote  at</span><span>  all.  It  is  to  be  assumed  that  those  who  spoilt  their  papers  and  did</span><span>  not  vote  were  definitely  opposed  to  the  present  regime  but  had  not</span><span>  got  the  courage  to  say  so.</span><span>  After  all,  the  present  circumstances  of  Germany  are  particularly</span><span>  unhappy.  The  country  is  on  the  verge  of  bankruptcy;  the  restric</span><span>  tions  upon  food,  clothing  and  raw  materials  are  reminiscent  of  war</span><span>  time  measures:  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  is  deeply  dissatisfied,</span><span>  and  the  Protestant  Church  not  less  so  ;  the  great  Industrialists  view</span><span>  with  horror  the  swing  of  Nazi  economic  doctrine  towards  Com</span><span>  munism  ;  even  in  the  ranks  of  Hitlerdom  there  is  certainly  great</span><span>  unrest.  Foreign  observers  in  the  country  regard  the  situation</span><span>  internally  with  considerable  apprehension.</span><span>  The  events  of  June  30,  when  a  number  of  Storm  Troopers  were</span><span>  shot  out  of  hand,  when  General  von  Schleicher  and  his  wife  were</span><span>  assassinated,  and  an  unknown  number  of  persons  disposed  of,  have</span><span>  left  a  very  sour  impression  in  Germany  as  to  the  future.  The  re</span><span>  ception  accorded  to  the  Chancellor,  when  he  addressed  the  Reichstag</span><span>  a  fortnight  after  those  events,  was  cool  in  the  extreme.  The  per</span><span>  sonal  accounts  of  eye  witnesses  are  now  available  in  Australia,  and</span><span>  confirm  in  every  detail  and  strengthen  the  observations  which  were</span><span>  cabled  to  this  country  at  that  time.  The  position  has  been  summed</span><span>  up  as  representing  the  end  of  Nazism  as  it  has  been  in  the  past,  and</span><span>  the  beginning  of  its  end  altogether.</span><span>  The  internal  position  in  Germany  is  of  the  first  importance,  not</span><span>  only  to  Germany,  but  to  the  rest  of  the  world,  because,  whatever</span><span>  happens  in  that  country  must  seriously  affect  affairs  in  other  parts</span><span>  of  the  world,  particularly  the  present  stage  of  economic  recovery.</span><span>  This  has  been  seen  in  Australia  by  the  fall  in  the  wool  market,  fol</span><span>  lowing  upon  the  embargo  laid  by  Germany  upon  the  import  of  raw</span><span>  material.  It  is  the  continued  uncertainty  as  to  what  will  eventuate</span><span>  in  that  country  which  still  dominates  the  wool  market,  and  indeed,</span><span>  all  other  markets  for  raw  materials.</span><span>  It  is  not  until  Germany  becomes  stabilised  under  one  form  of</span><span>  Government  or  another,  and  until  what  Shakespeare  calls  'the</span><span>  alarums  and  excursions'  in  that  country  cease,  and  its  unhappy</span><span>  people  can  settle  down  to  internal  peace  and  internal  development,</span><span>  that  the  general  situation  can  right  itself.</span></p> "

Since  she</span><span>  has  no  friends  to  lose  she  has  thrown</span><span>  all  the  laws  of  warfare  overboard</span><span>  and  is  prepared  to  sink  the  ships  of</span><span>  any  nation  in  a  desperate  attempt</span><span>  to  blockade  Britain  as  she  herself  is</span><span>  blockaded.  It  is  a  campaign  of  ter</span><span>  rorism  that  will  serve  only  to  hasten</span><span>  the  alignment  of  nations  in  active</span><span>  opposition  to  Germany  in  this  war.</span><span>  Apart  from  the  way  in  which  the</span><span>  mines  are  being  used,  the  terrific</span><span>  explosive  content  of  some  of  them</span><span>  is  proof  of  Germany's  hope  of  in</span><span>  timidating  all  shipping  movement  in</span><span>  English  waters.  The  charges  are  far</span><span>  stronger  than  necessary  merely  to</span><span>  sink  a  ship.  The  vessels  that  strike</span><span>  them  are  blown  almost  to  pieces,</span><span>  making  heavy  loss  of  civilian  life  in</span><span>  evitable.</span><span>  The  sinking  of  the  Japanese  liner,</span><span>  Terekuni  Maru,  will  cause  great</span><span>  anger  and  perturbation  in  Japan,  and</span><span>  may  have  a  profound  effect  upon</span><span>  Japanese  foreign  policy  at  a  time</span><span>  when  Nippon's  international  rela</span><span>  tions  are  in  a  state  of  flux.  It  will</span><span>  be  useless  for  Germany  to  blame  Mr.</span><span>  Winston  Churchill  for  the  mining  of</span><span>  this  vessel.  Surprisingly  enough,  the</span><span>  Nazis  have  now  admitted  that  their</span><span>  mines  have  been  responsible  for  the</span><span>  loss  of  the  neutral  vessels  sunk  dur</span><span>  ing  the  last  few  days.  \"Germany  re</span><span>  grets  it  if  the  results  are  rather  sad</span><span>  for  neutrals,  but  can  do  nothing</span><span>  about  it,\"  said  a  broadcast  from</span><span>  Hamburg.  Perhaps  she  would  not</span><span>  have  been  so  frank  had  she  known</span><span>  that  within  a  few  hours  a  crack  Jap</span><span>  anese  liner  was  to  be  sent  to  the</span><span>  bottom  of  the  sea  by  her  agency.</span><span>  Japan  will  consider  this  disaster  in</span><span>  conjunction  with  the  report  that</span><span>  Germany  has  bought  from  Russia</span><span>  twenty  submarines  for  operations  in</span><span>  the  Far  East  and  the  Indian  Ocpan.</span><span>  The  risk  of  total  war  being  extended</span><span>  by  Germany  to  these  seas  cannot  be</span><span>  dismissed.  So  far  as  Britain  is  con</span><span>  cerned,  it  is  extremely  unlikely  that</span><span>  the  new  German  frightfulness  will  be</span><span>  successful  in  cutting  her  off  from  the</span><span>  world  and  starving  her  into  submis</span><span>  sion.  The  mine  menace  was  dealt</span><span>  with  in  the  last  war,  and  there  is</span><span>  no  reason  to  fear  that  this  success</span><span>  will  not  be  repeated.</span></p> "

Taking  the</span><span>  referendum.  the  question  was-\"Do</span><span>  \"you,  German  man,  and  you,  German</span><span>  \"woman,  approve  of  the  policy  of  your</span><span>  \"Government?

If  the  vote  is  a  true  reflex</span><span>  of  opinion,  the  world  is  told  that</span><span>  7.000,000  Social  Democrats  and</span><span>  4.000,000  Communists  who  were</span><span>  against  the  Nazis  last  March  have</span><span>  been.  converted  by  a  brutal  terrorism</span><span>  into  enthusiastic  admiration  for  the</span><span>  Nazi  regime.

It  must  be  clearly,  understood</span><span>  that  when  a  nation  secures  a  loan  from</span><span>  another  nation  no  money  is  inter</span><span>  changed.  Goods  or  materials  are  taken</span><span>  to  the  amount  of  the  credits  extended.</span><span>  :  Since  1918  credits  have  been  extend</span><span>  ed  to  Germany  through  the  control  re</span><span>  serve  franking  system  in  America  and</span><span>  England,  and  Germany  as  a  conse</span><span>  quence  has  become  so  completely  or</span><span>  ganised  in  air,  field  and  naval  arma</span><span>  ments  that  she  is  able  to  ignore  the</span><span>  League  of  Nations,  defy  the  world  and</span><span>  .hop  over  and  win  unopposed  conquests,</span><span>  and  the  prevaricating,  subtle,  under</span><span>  mining  diplomacy  stills  prevails  to  draw</span><span>  further  goods  and  materials  to  the</span><span>  strorighold.  Blatantly  denying</span><span>  the  responsibility  for  the  last  war,  she</span><span>  may  yet  blame  Britain  for  the  next  be</span><span>  cause  the  world  is  not  willing  to  hand</span><span>  over  mandated  territories  upon  demand.</span><span>  It  must  be  clearly  ,  understood  that  the</span><span>  world  is  not  dealing  with  German</span><span>  people,  who  are  a  very  fine  race.  A</span><span>  gang  of  fiends  who  are  organising  world</span><span>  wide  mass  murder,  hide  behind  all  this</span><span>  vast  camouflage  and  the  German  people</span><span>  are  .  hungry  because  their  resources,</span><span>  energy  and  hundreds  of  millions  Of</span><span>  pounds  of  their  wealth  are  absorbed</span><span>  annually  in  the  maintenance  and  fur</span><span>  ther  development  of  the  mighty  war</span><span>  organisation.</span><span>  The  bluff  about  being  unable  to  pay</span><span>  has  continued  all  too  long.  The  people</span><span>  of  the  world  in  general,  and  Great  Bri</span><span>  tain  in  particular,  should  rub  their</span><span>  sleepy  eyes  and  realise  what  is  hap</span><span>  pening  by  the  international  money  sys</span><span>  tem  controlling  and  extending  credits.</span><span>  When  Great  Britain  needs  armaments</span><span>  for  defence,  made  necessary  by  such</span><span>  gigantic  and,  advanced  preparations  in</span><span>  Germany,  she  is  told  by  the  same  inter</span><span>  national  money  monopoly  that  she  must</span><span>  provide  her  defences  from  taxation.</span><span>  It  is  to  be  regretted  that  there  is  an</span><span>  absence  of  such  writers  on  national  and</span><span>  international  affairs.</span><span>  In  substantiation  of  Mr.  Ager's  con</span><span>  tribution,  I  quote  a  broadcast  speeclFby</span><span>  Dr.  Goddard  on  Sunday  night,  February</span><span>  14,  on  international  affairs  from  2BL</span><span>  recorded  in  \"The  Book  of  Time.\"  Per</span><span>  chance  many  listeners  are  aware  that</span><span>  Dr.  Goddard  is  an  authority  on  inter</span><span>  national  affairs.  He  said:  Germany  in</span><span>  her  race  for  armaments  is  depriving</span><span>  every  individual  population  of  £160  of</span><span>  food  yearly.</span><span>  -From  time  to  time  the  cables  flash</span><span>  across  the  world  some  startling  arith</span><span>  metic,  but  unfortunately  the  country</span><span>  press  only  receives  a  brevis  .  account  -in</span><span>  a  condensed  or  mutilated  'form.  Since</span></p> <p><span>  1914  to  1927  it  has  been  my  hobby  to</span><span>  devote  my  leisure  to  national  and  in</span><span>  ternational  affairs  published  monthly  in</span><span>  the  magazine  \"Life.\"</span><span>  Some  newspaper  writers,  -of  course,</span><span>  if  only  by  force,  of  habit,  reflect  and</span><span>  exaggerate  the  mood  ;  of  the  moment,</span><span>  and  they  change  with  the  mood.  They</span><span>  are  not  so  closely  in  touch  with  actual</span><span>  facts.</span><span>  .DISTRACTED  GERMANY.</span><span>  Germany,  to  the  hasty  observer,  might</span><span>  well  seem  to  be  on  the  point  of  bank</span><span>  ruptcy.  In  1923  Sir  Phillip  Gibbs,  thei</span><span>  noted  war  correspondent,  visited  .  Ger-  1</span><span>  many,  and  gave  a  graphic  story  of  what:</span><span>  he  saw  there.  He  said,  however,  that</span><span>  with  the  mark  at  5uo,000,000  to  the  Eng</span><span>  lish  pound  note  there  was  still  no  out</span><span>  ward  sign  of  poverty  or  rum  in  Ger</span><span>  many.\"  He  could  not  make  head  or</span><span>  cail  of  this  wild  melodrama  of  paper</span><span>  money  which,  fell  .In  value  by  tens:,  of</span><span>  millions  between  the  \"soup  and  the</span><span>  xoffee  of  his  midday  meal.  It  seemed</span><span>  to  make  \"no  difference  \"  tOtKe  people.</span><span>  They  still  thronged  the  restaurants  and</span><span>  cabarets  and  though  .prices  rose.  auto</span><span>  matically  as  the  exchange  falls,  thev</span><span>  .eemed  to  get  enough  of  this  f\\ntastic</span><span>  currency  to  pay  f  0  c.  their  pleasure  as</span><span>  well  as  their  necessity.  \"But,\"  he</span><span>  added,  \"this  is  the  way  in  which  mod</span><span>  ern  civilisation  '  masks  for  a  time  the</span><span>  decay  and  the  disease  which  are  eating</span><span>  at  its  vitals  like  a  spreading  cancer.\"</span><span>  Even  to  the  cool  Australian  mind</span><span>  looking  across  the  sea  at  the  distrac</span><span>  tions  and  tumult  of  what  we  call  \"Ger</span><span>  many,\"  it  seems  .that.it  offers  a  spec</span><span>  tacle  of  ruin  such  as  Europe  has  not</span><span>  seen  since  the  Forty  Years'  \"Vvar.  Yet</span><span>  the  ruin  is  not  brought  on  Germany  by</span></p> <p><span>  the  sword  of  its  enemies,  but  by  the</span><span>  insane  policy  of  its  own  rulers.  They</span><span>  were  too  proud  to  accept  defeat,  and</span><span>  have  tried  to  evade;  its  just  conse</span><span>  quences.  The  German  currency  has</span><span>  been  deliberately  ruined—  and  ruined</span><span>  on  a  scale  unknown;.in  history—  as  part</span><span>  of  the  plan  to  make  the  payment  of</span><span>  the  reparations  for  the  wrongs  done  to</span><span>  the  nations  it  attacked.  We  have  but</span><span>  to  contrast  how  Germany  treated</span><span>  France  in  1870.  For  six  months'  war</span><span>  she  exacted  a  fine  of  £200,000,000  —  and</span><span>  Alsace-Lorraine!  And  her  troops  were</span><span>  quartered  on  France  -till  this  penalty</span><span>  was  paid.  .Or  we  have  but  to  contrast</span><span>  the  policy  since  defeat  adopted  by</span><span>  Austria  with  that  of  Germany  to  realise</span><span>  that  Germany  has.  brought'  upon  itself</span><span>  the  suffering  which  now  almost  theatens</span><span>  it  with  destruction.  Austria  accepted</span><span>  its  defeat,  and  has  honestly  paid,  as  far</span><span>  as  possible  the  price  of  defeat!  As  a</span><span>  result,  it  has  the  sympathy  and  help  of</span><span>  Europe,  and  is  back  towards  prosper</span><span>  ity.  It  is  cruel,  perhaps,  to  say  that  '</span><span>  Germany  has  tried  to  cheat  its  creditors,</span><span>  but  has  it  honestly  tried'  to  pay  them?</span><span>  THE  DANCE  OF  THE  GERMAN</span><span>  MARK.</span><span>  Only  a  mathematician  accustomed  to</span><span>  deal  with  what-  may  be  called  astrono</span><span>  mical  magnitudes  can  keep  touch  with</span><span>  the  performances  of  the  German  mark;</span><span>  but  a  record  of  its  gyrations  during,</span><span>  say,  a  single  fortnight,  may  be  attempt</span><span>  ed.  The  week  before  the  issue  of  the</span><span>  Baldwin-Curzon  note,  the  German  mark</span><span>  was  rated  at  4,000,000  to  the  dollar,  a'rid</span><span>  under  the  influence  of  the  British  letter</span></p> <p><span>  it  went  up  a  few  points  and  reached</span><span>  2.500,000  to  the  dollar.  Then  came  the</span><span>  blast  of  Poincai-e's  reply,  with  its  twin</span><span>  document  from  Brussels,  and  the  mark</span><span>  tumbled  down  with  meteoric  speed  till</span><span>  it  touched  about  7,000,000;:  and  then</span><span>  8,000,000  to  the  dollar.  On.:  September</span><span>  5,  1923,  it  had  gone  almost  completely</span><span>  out  of  sight,  as  it  descended  to</span><span>  20,000,000  to  the  dollar,  and  continued</span><span>  its  downward  flight  till  it  actually</span><span>  reached  44,000,000  to  the  dollar.</span><span>  The  mark,  it  must  be  remembered,</span><span>  .before  the  Great  War,  was  equal  in</span><span>  I  value  to  the  British  shilling;  at  the</span><span>  point  reached  it  was  equal  to  a  forty-</span><span>  millionth  part  of  a  dollar,  a  value  which</span><span>  only  a  microscope  of  the  highest  magni</span><span>  fying  power  could  do  so  much  as  see.</span><span>  It  was  expected  then  to  fall  tc</span><span>  100,  LOU,  000  to  the  dollar\",  which</span><span>  is  about  zero,  and  at  that  stage  \"not</span><span>  only  cities,  towns  and  Villages,  but</span><span>  State  railways,  banks,  manufacturing</span><span>  co-operations,  business  houses  and  even  .</span><span>  individuals  have  been  printing  and</span><span>  issuing  their  own  flat  money  during  tnc  I</span><span>  shortage.\"  Now,  how  can  civilised</span><span>  existence  continue  under  such  con</span><span>  ditions?  And  since  then  the  mark  has</span><span>  fallen  to  yet  lower  depths!—  I  am,  etc.,</span></p> <p><span>  PETER  KNIGHT.  -</span></p> "

No  doubt  a  great  part  of</span><span>  the  muddle  was  due  to  the  insistence</span><span>  of  President  Wilson  that  the  adjust-</span><span>  ment  of  conditions  must  be  delayed</span><span>  until  his  own  special,  fad  was  dealt</span><span>  with.  Certainly  that  insistence  was</span><span>  responsible  for  the  hasty  creation  of</span><span>  the  League  of  Nations,  but  since</span><span>  America  at  once  repudiated  the  under-</span><span>  takings  of  her  President,  nothing  was</span><span>  gained.  The  history  of  the  world</span><span>  since  has  been  a  sad  one.  Some  of  the</span><span>  clauses  of  the  Treaty  of  Versailles</span><span>  have  been  ignored,  and  the  financial</span><span>  clauses  of  this  and  other  treaties  have</span><span>  been  changed,  and  changed  again,  un-</span><span>  til  they  are  unrecognisable.  And  now</span><span>  Germany  is  in  a  condition  of  practical</span><span>  revolt  against  the  conditions  of  the</span><span>  Treaty  limiting  her  right  to  arma-</span><span>  ments.  For  this  spirit,  we  arc  sorry</span><span>  to  say,  France  has  some  responsibility.</span><span>  In  spite  of  the  fact  that  Germany  has</span><span>  been  left  practically  helpless  for  ag-</span><span>  gression,  France  refuses  every  sugges-</span><span>  tion  for  a  substantial  reduction  of</span><span>  armaments.  Perhaps  this  consistent</span><span>  refusal,  and  the  examples  of  chauvin-</span><span>  ism,  are  more  directed  against  Italy,</span><span>  but,  in  order  to  avoid  complications,</span><span>  Germany  is  held  up  as  the  potential</span><span>  enemy.  There  has  been  much  adverse</span><span>  comment  as  to  the  failure  of  Great</span><span>  Britain,  through  the  League  of  Na-</span><span>  tions,  or  otherwise,  to  bring  about  a</span><span>  settlement.  This  criticism  is  not  just.</span><span>  Great  Britain  has,  during  and  since</span><span>  the  War,  pulled  so  many  chestnuts  out</span><span>  of  the  fire  for  others,  all  of  whom  were</span><span>  ungrateful,  thal  suggestions  of  further</span><span>  burning  of  fingers  in  the  cause  of  al-</span><span>  truism  are  not  welcomed.  If  France</span><span>  really  reduced  armaments,  probably</span><span>  Germany  would  not  make  any  demand</span><span>  for  equality.</span></p> "

He  said,</span><span>  for  instance,  that  the  Kaiser  aban</span></p> <p><span>  doned  the  policy  of  Bismark,  which</span><span>  stood  for  European  concentration,</span><span>  friendly  alliance,  and  prevention  by</span><span>  diplomacy  of  alliances  between  other</span><span>  countries.  On  the  contrary,  ihe  Bis</span><span>  markian  policy  was  one  of  deliberate</span><span>  and  ruthless  conquest.  His  famous  de</span><span>  claration  was  that  the  destinies  of</span><span>  Germany  were  to  be  worked  out  not</span><span>  by  notes  and  speeches,  but  by  blood</span><span>  and  iron.  His  three  successful  wars  in</span><span>  six  years  earned  for  him  the  name</span><span>  of  'The  Iron  Chancellor.'</span><span>  Mr.  Jones  says  that  during  the</span><span>  Spanish-American  war,  the  Kaiser  ap</span><span>  proached  England  with  regard  to  op</span><span>  posing  the  United  States,  and  that</span><span>  England  stood  by  America.  But  Mr.</span><span>  Usher,  in  his  book,  asserts  that  the</span><span>  Spanish-American  war  was  instigated</span><span>  by  England  in  order  to  prevent  Ger</span><span>  many  from  acquiring  the  Spanish</span><span>  colonies.  Both  statements  may  be</span><span>  wrong.</span><span>  Again,  Mr.  Jones  says  that  during</span><span>  the  Boer  War,  Germany  made  over</span><span>  tures  to  France  and  Russia,  suggest</span><span>  ing  combined  action  against  England,</span><span>  but  that  they  refused.  According  lo</span><span>  historians  Russia  and  France  were  pre</span><span>  pared  to  intervene  on  behalf  of  the</span><span>  Boer  Republic  if  Germany  would  join,</span><span>  but  she  refused  to  do  so.  In  1899</span><span>  the  London  'Daily  Mail'  was  full  of</span><span>  praise  of  Germany.  The  Kaiser  was</span><span>  hailed  as  'a  '  friend  in  need,  and  a</span><span>  gallant  gentleman  whose  word  is  bet</span><span>  ter  than  many  another's  bond.1',</span><span>  Mr.  Jones  refers  to  General  Bern</span><span>  hardi's  book  as  proof  of  Germany's</span><span>  guilt,  A  book,  exactly  parallel  to</span><span>  General  Bernhardi's,  entitled  'L'Of-</span></p> <p><span>  fensive  Contre  Allemagne'  has  been</span><span>  written  in  France  by  Colonel  Boucher.</span><span>  Another  correspondent,  Mr.  Watson,</span><span>  mentioned  the  Agadir  incident,  m  1911</span><span>  French  and  Spanish  troops  had  all</span><span>  leir  spheres  marked  out  for  them  by  '</span><span>  the  secret  articles  in  the  Anglo-French</span><span>  agreement.  France  took  the  lead  in</span><span>  threatening  war.  Germany  sent  'The</span><span>  Panther'  to  Agadir  as  a  protest.

We  think  that  text-books</span><span>  for  beginners  should  make  the  student  acquainted</span><span>  with  the  living  rather  than  the  dead  language  by</span><span>  interesting  him  in  stories  of  contemporary  life.

And  it  Is  almost  in</span><span>  credible  how  marvellously  they</span><span>  succeeded  in  nearly  every  cultural</span><span>  province.</span></p> <p><span>  At  first  thought  it  may  seem</span><span>  not  worth  the  while  to  remember</span><span>  what  the  Jews  have  achieved  in</span><span>  Germany  and  for  Germany.  In</span><span>  deed  the  wheels  of  history  will  not</span><span>  be  turned  into  any  other  direction</span><span>  by  the  statement  how  much  the</span><span>  Jews  have  added  to  the  benefit</span><span>  of  German  name  and  German</span><span>  fame.  But  it  will  buttress  the</span><span>  proud  and  the  certain  feeling  of</span><span>  the  Jews  themselves  that  one  day</span><span>  when  the  waves  of  hatred  will</span><span>  have  been  .  calmed  down  Jewish</span><span>  accomplishments  will  be  recognis</span><span>  ed  again  and  that  the  world  will</span><span>  give  the  Jews  that  place,  in  the</span><span>  council  of  peoples  for  which  they</span></p> <p><span>  .  are  entitled  to  claim.</span></p> <p><span>  When  the  Jews  in  the  beginning</span><span>  of  the  19th  century  were—ac</span><span>  least  formally—admitted  as  equal</span><span>  to  the  community  of  free  men  in</span><span>  Germany,  it  was  as  if  a  bulwark</span><span>  had  been  broken  down  and  the</span><span>  water  dammed  up  behind  it  had</span><span>  fallen  like  a  torrent  into  the  open</span><span>  land.  So  powerful  was  the  mental</span><span>  energy  that  became  free  and  ru</span><span>  shed  down  into  every  district  of</span><span>  spiritual  activity.  Impossible  to</span><span>  count  down  every  Jew  who  has</span><span>  added  stones  to  the  edifice  of  Ger</span><span>  man  art  and  science.  We  can  give</span><span>  only  a  few  names  out  of  thou</span><span>  sands.  But  we  can  appraise  the</span><span>  real  significance  of  that  powerful,</span><span>  stream  of  spii’itual  fructification</span><span>  only  if  we  consider  that  the  Jews</span><span>  comprising  but  1  per  cent  of  the</span><span>  German  population  at  once  took</span><span>  part  in  the  building  up  of  the  cul</span><span>  tural  life  by  contributors  out</span><span>  numbering  10  or  even  20  times</span><span>  their  actual  proportion  of  the  po</span><span>  pulation.  An  example  may  make</span><span>  it  clear  how  this  miraculous  fact</span><span>  turned  out  to  be  of  almost  in</span><span>  credible  .  effects:  The  Jews  for  in</span><span>  stance  brought  forth  9  remarkable</span><span>  composers  in  a  little  more  than</span><span>  one  century;  the  Germans,  in  or</span><span>  der  to  keep  pace  should  have  had</span><span>  to  muster  900  (!)  equivalent  ta</span><span>  lents  or  take  another  example:</span><span>  About  25  per  cent  of  the  German</span><span>  Nobel-prize  winners  were  Jews,</span><span>  equal  to  five  .times  more  than</span><span>  their  proportion.  And  so  it/-  was</span><span>  in  nearly  every  district  of  cultural</span></p> <p><span>  life.</span></p> <p><span>  At  the  beginning  of  that  “Pe-  ,</span><span>  riod  of  Enlightenment”,  stands  the</span><span>  venerable  figure  of  the  poor  hunch</span><span>  backed  office  clerk  and  great</span><span>  philosopher  Moses  Mendelssohn,</span><span>  the  friend  of  Lessing.  He  was  still</span><span>  deep-rooted  in  Jewish  feelings  and</span><span>  it  was  but  in  his  adult  years  that</span></p> <p><span>  he  learnt  to  write  German.  Pro</span><span>  found  was  his  influence  on  Ger</span><span>  man  philosophy.  (The  fate  of  his</span><span>  children  is  significant;  it  shows</span><span>  how  quickly  by  the  way  of  assi</span><span>  milation  large  and  valuable  parts</span><span>  of  Jewry  have  been  absorbed  by</span><span>  the  German  people:  Two  of  his</span><span>  sons,  baptized,  became  the  found</span><span>  ers’  of  one  of  most  famous  Euro</span><span>  pean  Banks.  His  daughter,  also</span><span>  baptised,  was  renowned  for  her</span><span>  literary  salon  and  played  an  im</span><span>  portant  part  in  the  history  of  Ger</span><span>  man  literature.  His  grandson  Felix</span><span>  Mendelssohn-Bartholdy,  baptised,</span><span>  was  one  of  the  greatest  German</span><span>  composers.  And  many  of  his  des</span><span>  cendents  are  reputed  as  artists</span><span>  and  scientists).  Besides  Mendel</span><span>  ssohn  there  were  many  more  Jew</span><span>  ish  philosophers  as  for  instance</span><span>  Salomon  Maimon,  Otto  Liebmann,</span><span>  Herman  Cohen,  Gustav  ^  Simmel,</span><span>  Gustav  Landauer  etc.  Although,</span><span>  they  were  not  the  great  lonely</span><span>  stars  they  influenced  largely</span><span>  thoughts  and  ideas  in  Germany.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  discipline  of  Physics,</span><span>  Mathematics  and  Physics  near  to</span><span>  the  province  of  Philosophy,  scores</span><span>  of  Jews  excelled.  The  one  Einstein</span><span>  would  suffice  to  procure  the  Jews</span><span>  a  place  of  honour  in  the  history</span><span>  of  Science.  Only  the  coming  cen</span><span>  turies  can  judge  fully  his  import</span><span>  ance.  But  he  seems  to  be  a  genius</span><span>  the  like  of  whom  mankind  pro</span><span>  duces  only  every  some  centuries  to</span><span>  be  placed  in  line  with  men  like</span><span>  Ptolemy,  Galileo,  Giordano  Bruno</span><span>  and  Newton.  And  there  are  many</span><span>  others  whose  names  can  keep  the</span><span>  field  also  besides  Einstein.  Hertz</span><span>  (theory  .  of  electric  waves),  J.</span><span>  Frank  (theory  of  atoms),  David</span><span>  sohn  (electro  motor),  Marcus</span><span>  (petrol  motor),  Berliner  (micro</span><span>  phone),  Haber  (nitrogen),  Frank</span><span>  (Kali),  Caro  (dyes),  Willstaetter</span><span>  (Chlorophyl),  Bayer,  the  son  of  a</span><span>  Jewish  mother  and  the  founder  of</span><span>  the'  mighty  German  Dye  concern</span><span>  (indigo)  and  practically  thou</span><span>  sands  of  famous  names  more.</span></p> <p><span>  Jews  have  always  been  prepon</span><span>  derant  physicians  and  that  may</span><span>  partly  explain  the  fact  that  there</span><span>  was  nearly  no  inventive  medical</span><span>  achievement  without  Jewish  guid</span></p> <p><span>  ance  or  at  least  Jewish  assistance.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  almost  impossible  an  under</span><span>  taking  to  enumerate  the  names  of</span><span>  the  countless  medical  pioneers  and</span><span>  only  a  few  ones  may  therefore  be</span><span>  mentioned  who  acquired  wide  pub</span><span>  lic  fame.  So  Meyerhof  (transfor</span></p> <p><span>  mation  of  energy),  Zunz  (physio</span><span>  logy),  Ehrlich  (Salvarsan),  Was</span><span>  sermann  and  Morgenroth  (both</span><span>  diagnosis  of  syphilis,  Freud</span><span>  (psychoanalysis),  Adler  (indivi</span><span>  dual  psychology),  Minkowsky</span><span>  (diabetes),  Boas  (stomach  di</span><span>  seases),  Zondeck  (internal  di</span><span>  seases),  Asehheim  (pregnancy</span><span>  diagnosis)  etc.</span></p> <p><span>  ,  But  how  much  soever  all  these</span><span>  contributions  have  added  to  the</span><span>  famous  reputation  of  German  cul</span><span>  ture  the  public  in  general  knew</span><span>  and  appreciated  better  the  Jews,</span><span>  who  worked  in  the  sphere  of  the</span><span>  arts.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  first  line  it  was  the  Jew</span><span>  ish  musicians  who,  even  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  land  of  music  proper”  attracted</span></p> <p><span>  the  eyes  or  rather  the  ears  of</span><span>  their  contemporaries.  There  •  are</span><span>  the  composers  Mendelssohn,  Mey</span><span>  ei’beer,  Offenbach,  Moscheles,  Ru</span><span>  binstein,  Joachim,  Mahler,  Schoen</span><span>  berg,  Korngold,  there  are  the  con</span><span>  ducted  Walter,  Klemperer,  Klei</span><span>  ber,  there  are  the  countless  prac</span><span>  titioning  musicians'  of  world-wide</span><span>  fame  like  Schnabel,  Horowitz,  Ser</span><span>  kin,  Hubermann,  Kreisler,  Morini,</span><span>  Tauber  and  scores  of  them  more.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  art  of  painting  it  was</span><span>  Liebermann,  Israels,  Lesser  Ury,</span><span>  Chagall,  Feinger,  Marees  (a  half</span><span>  Jew)  etc.  who  helped  to  develop</span><span>  German  artistic  reputation.  That</span><span>  seems  to  be  indeed  a  very  surpris</span><span>  ing  fact.  For  since  the  Jews,  pre</span></p> <p><span>  (Continued  on  page  6)</span></p> <p><span>  GERMAN  JEWS  AND  GERMAN  CULTURE</span></p> <p><span>  (Continued  from  page  4)</span></p> <p><span>  vented  by  religious  prohibitions,</span><span>  had  never  excelled  in  the  field  of</span><span>  painting  it  was  all  the  more  mir</span><span>  aculous  that  they  could  hold  their</span><span>  own  without  any  existing  artistic</span></p> <p><span>  tradition.</span></p> <p><span>  Always  have  the  Jews  been  bear</span><span>  ers  of  a  deep  inner  conscience  and</span><span>  masters  of  the  word.  Since  the</span><span>  days  of  the  Prophets  they  have</span><span>  been  the  proclaimed  and  propa</span><span>  gators  of  teachings,  doctrines  and</span><span>  convictions.  That  may  be  the  ex</span><span>  planation  of  the  immense  part</span><span>  played  by  Jews  in  the  German</span><span>  literature.  The  way  leading  from</span><span>  Heinrich  Heine  to  Stephan  Zweig</span><span>  is  short  in  time  but  overcrowded</span><span>  by  writing,  composing,  teaching</span><span>  and  admonishing  Jews:  Boeme</span><span>  and  Weininger,  Wassermann  and</span><span>  Werfel,  Kaffka  and  Heimann,</span><span>  Schnitzler  and  Hofmannsthal,  Bu</span><span>  ber  and  Mombert,  Toller  and</span><span>  Weissi,  Brod  and  Arnold  Zweig,</span><span>  Doeblin  and  Beer-Hoffmann  are</span><span>  only  a  few  names  casually  picked</span><span>  out  of  the  innumerable  spiritual</span><span>  Jews  who  have  influenced  the</span><span>  thoughts  and  feelings  of  the  Ger</span><span>  man  people.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  practically  impossible  even</span><span>  if  the  limited  space  would  not</span><span>  prohibit  it—to  mention  every  do</span></p> <p><span>  main  where  the  Jews  had  a  share</span><span>  in  the  shaping  of  German  culture.</span><span>  Industry  and  economicsi,  sociology</span><span>  and  agriculture,  film  and  theatre</span><span>  dance  and  architecture,  journal</span><span>  istics  and  playwriting,  charity  and</span></p> <p><span>  art-donations  were  but  a  few  ones</span><span>  of  the  vast  provinces  of  Jewish</span></p> <p><span>  collaboration.</span></p> <p><span>  How  is  it  possible  that  in  spite</span><span>  of  all  this  cultural  work  done  by</span><span>  Jews  the  terrible  outbursts  of</span><span>  cruelty  against  the  German  Jews</span><span>  could  happen  ?  Probably  because</span><span>  the  people  did  not  know  how  great</span></p> <p><span>  the  share  of  the  Jews-  in  all  those</span><span>  cultural  achievements  had  been.</span></p> <p><span>  For  however  magnificent  the</span><span>  Jewish  accomplishments  were</span><span>  they  did  not  reach  the  bulk  of  the</span><span>  people.  The  ideas  of  the  Jewish</span><span>  writers'  were  too  elaborate,  too</span><span>  high-brow,  to  be  understood  by</span><span>  the  masses.  They  became  the  spi</span><span>  ritual  food  of  the  intelligentsia</span><span>  with  the  exception  of  Heine  whose</span></p> <p><span>  poems  are  recited  and  sung  by  the</span><span>  whole  of  Germany,  .  but  .  mostly</span><span>  without  any  knowledge  who  wrote</span><span>  those  deeply  touching  songs.  And</span><span>  again  the  composers  although</span><span>  some  of  thefn  being  pacemakers  of</span><span>  new  musical  ways  did  not  pene</span><span>  trate  into  the  people’s  hearts,  be</span><span>  side  Mendelssohn  whose  songs</span><span>  went  straight  to  the  people’s  feel</span><span>  ings.  And  even  men  who  achieved</span><span>  the  most  practical  successes  like</span><span>  Haber  who  saved  Germany  from</span><span>  losing  the  world  war  in  its  first</span><span>  year,  or  Ehrlich  who  released  the</span><span>  world  from  one  of  its  deadliest</span><span>  plagues,  were  not  popular  because</span><span>  the  simple-minded  maxi,  could  not</span><span>  conceive  their  complicated  con</span><span>  structive  work.</span></p> <p><span>  Shall  we  wonder  about  it?  No,</span><span>  for  not  even  the  Jewish  ^masses</span><span>  knew  it.  Even  now  after  the  last</span><span>  years  of  Jewish  persecution  and</span><span>  reawakening  of  Jewish  conscious</span><span>  ness  a  French  Jew  with  whom  I</span><span>  conversed  recently  had  no  idea</span><span>  that  Bergson  and  Andre  Maurois</span></p> <p><span>  were  Jews  and  Anatole  France</span><span>  half  of  Jewish  parentage.</span></p> <p><span>  Must  we  therefore  assume  that</span><span>  all  the  cultural  work  done  by</span><span>  Jews  has  been  in  vain?  Certainly</span><span>  not.  Material  values  can  be  lost,</span><span>  money,  houses,  diamonds  can  be</span><span>  destroyed  but  spiritual  values  that</span><span>  have  been  produced  remain..  Books</span><span>  which  have  been  printed  can  be</span><span>  burnt  but  their  contents  cannot  be</span><span>  burned.  Heads  can  be  cut  off.but</span><span>  thoughts  which  they  had  spoken</span><span>  out,  the  songs  which  have  been</span><span>  sung,  cannot  been  drowned,  smoth</span><span>  ered,  hanged.  The  cultural  achive</span><span>  ments  the  Jews  have  produced  in</span><span>  Germany  will  be  remain  alive  and</span><span>  there  will  be  again  a  time  of</span><span>  peace  when  all  that  Einstein  and</span><span>  Freud,  Mendelssohn  and  Heine</span><span>  have  thought,  said,  written  and</span><span>  sung,  will  again  be  heard,  read</span><span>  and  sung,  and  when  again  will  be</span><span>  thought  of  with  deep  and  kind</span><span>  feelings  of  thankfulness  those  men</span><span>  who  have  served  the  progress  of</span><span>  man  with  the  best  of  their  lives.</span></p> <p><span>  But  something  more  will  come</span><span>  out  again  of  the  marvellous  riches</span><span>  of  Jewish  spirit.  Those  riches</span><span>  which  have  survived  the  centuries</span></p> <p><span>  of  prosecution  will  remain  in  the</span><span>  same  way  alive  in  spite  df  the  new</span><span>  pains  that  have  come  down  over</span><span>  Jewry.  The  men  who  have  pro</span><span>  duced  all  those  miracles  of  their</span><span>  spirits  have  had  to  go  again  on</span><span>  their  new  travels  throughout  the</span><span>  world.  They  had  to  leave  behind</span><span>  them  their  fortunes,  their  money,</span><span>  even  their  clothes.  But  they  have</span><span>  taken  along  with  thentselves  their</span><span>  unbroken  spirit.  That  spirit  wher</span><span>  ever  the  Jews  will  be  driven  out</span></p> <p><span>  and  wherever  they  ‘  will  settle</span><span>  afresh  will  fructify  again  mankind</span><span>  for  the  benefit  of  the  human  race</span><span>  and  to  the  honour  of  the  Jewish</span></p> <p><span>  name.</span></p> "

Since  the</span><span>  days  of  the  Prophets  they  have</span><span>  been  the  proclaimed  and  propa</span><span>  gators  of  teachings,  doctrines  and</span><span>  convictions.  That  may  be  the  ex</span><span>  planation  of  the  immense  part</span><span>  played  by  Jews  in  the  German</span><span>  literature.  The  way  leading  from</span><span>  Heinrich  Heine  to  Stephan  Zweig</span><span>  is  short  in  time  but  overcrowded</span><span>  by  writing,  composing,  teaching</span><span>  and  admonishing  Jews:  Boerne</span><span>  and  Weininger,  Wassermann  and</span><span>  Werfel,  Kaffka  and  Heimann,</span><span>  Schnitzler  and  Hofmannsthal,  Bu</span><span>  ber  and  Mombert,  Toller  and</span><span>  Weiss,  Brod  and  Arnold  Zweig,</span><span>  Doeblin  and  Beer-Hoffmann  are</span></p> <p><span>  only  a  few  names  casually  picked</span><span>  out  of  the  innumerable  spiritual</span><span>  Jews  who  have  influenced  the</span></p> <p><span>  thoughts  and  feelings  of  the  Ger</span><span>  man  people.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  practically  impossible  even</span><span>  if  the  limited  space  would  not</span><span>  prohibit  it—to  mention  every  do</span><span>  main  where  the  Jews  had  a  share</span><span>  in  the  shaping  of  German  culture.</span><span>  Industry  and  economics:,  sociology</span><span>  and  agriculture,  film  and  theatre</span><span>  dance  and  architecture,  journal</span><span>  istics  and  playwriting,  charity  and</span><span>  art-donations  were  but  a  few  ones</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  vast  provinces  of  Jewish</span></p> <p><span>  collaboration.</span></p> <p><span>  How  is  it  possible  that  in  spite</span><span>  of  all  this  cultural  work  done  by</span><span>  Jews  the  terrible  outbursts  of</span><span>  cruelty  against  the  German  Jews</span><span>  could  happen  ?  Probably  because</span><span>  the  people  did  not  know  how  great</span><span>  the  share  of  the  Jews  in  all  those</span><span>  cultural  achievements  had  been.</span></p> <p><span>  For  however  magnificent  the</span><span>  Jewish  accomplishments  were</span><span>  they  did  not  reach  the  bulk  of  the</span><span>  people.  The  ideas  of  the  Jewish</span><span>  writers'  were  too  elaborate,  too</span><span>  high-brow,  to  be  understood  by</span><span>  the  masses.  They  became  the  spi</span><span>  ritual  food  of  the  intelligentsia,</span><span>  with  the  exception  of  Heine  whose</span><span>  poems  are  recited,  and  sung  by  the</span><span>  whole  of  Germany,  but  mostly</span><span>  without  any  knowledge  who  wrote</span><span>  those  deeply  touching  songs.  And</span><span>  again  the  composers  although</span><span>  some  of  them  being  pacemakers  of</span><span>  new  musical  ways  did  not  pene</span><span>  trate  into  the  people’s  hearts,  be</span></p> <p><span>  side  Mendelssohn  whose  songs</span><span>  went  straight  to  the  people’s  feel</span><span>  ings.  And  even  men  who  achieved</span><span>  the  most  practical  successes  like</span><span>  Haber  who  saved  Germany  from</span></p> <p><span>  losing  the  world  war  in  its  first  I</span><span>  year,  or  Ehrlich  who  released  the</span><span>  world  from  one  of  its  deadliest</span><span>  plagues,  were  not  popular  because</span><span>  the  simple-minded  man  could  not</span><span>  conceive  their  complicated  con</span></p> <p><span>  structive  work.</span></p> <p><span>  Shall  we  wonder  about  it?  No,</span><span>  for  not  even  the  Jewish  masses</span><span>  knew  it.  Even  now  after  the  last</span><span>  years  of  Jewish  persecution  and</span><span>  reawakening  of  Jewish  conscious</span><span>  ness  a  French  Jew  with  whom  I</span><span>  conversed  recently  had  no  idea</span><span>  that  Bergson  and  Andre  Maurois</span><span>  were  Jews  and  Anatole  France</span><span>  half  of  Jewish  parentage.</span></p> <p><span>  Must  we  therefore  assume  that</span><span>  all  the  cultural  work  done  by</span><span>  Jews  has  been  in  vain?  Certainly</span><span>  not.  Material  values  can  be  lost,</span><span>  money,  houses,  diamonds  can  .be</span><span>  destroyed  but  spiritual  values  that</span><span>  have  been  produced  remain.  Books</span><span>  which  have  been  printed  can  be</span><span>  burnt  but  their  contents  cannot  be</span></p> <p><span>  |  burned.  Heads  can  be  cut  off  but</span></p> <p><span>  thoughts  which  they  had  spoken</span><span>  out,  the  songs  which  have  been</span><span>  sung,  cannot  been  drowned,  smoth</span><span>  ered,  hanged.  The  cultural  achive</span><span>  ments  the  Jews  have  produced  in.</span><span>  Germany  will  be  remain  alive  and</span><span>  there  will  be  again  a  time  of</span><span>  peace  when  all  that  Einstein  and</span><span>  Freud,  Mendelssohn  and  Heine</span><span>  have  thought,  said,  written  and</span><span>  sung,  will  again  be  heard,  read</span><span>  and  sung,  and  when  again  will  be</span><span>  thought  of  with  deep  and  kind</span><span>  feelings  of  thankfulness  those  men</span><span>  who  have  served  the  progress  of</span><span>  man  with  the  best  of  their  lives.</span></p> <p><span>  But  something  more  will  come</span><span>  out  again  of  the  marvellous  riches</span><span>  of  Jewish  spirit.  Those  riches</span><span>  which  have  survived  the  centuries</span><span>  of  prosecution  will  remain  in  the</span><span>  same  way  alive  in  spite  of  the  new</span><span>  pains  that  have  come  down  over</span><span>  Jewry.  The  men  who  have  pro</span><span>  duced  all  those  miracles  of  their</span><span>  spirits  have  had  to  go  again  on</span><span>  their  new  travels  throughout  the</span><span>  world.  They  had  to  leave  behind</span><span>  them  their  fortunes,  their  money,</span><span>  even  their  clothes.  But  they  have</span><span>  taken  along  with  themselves  their</span><span>  unbroken  spirit.  That  spirit  wher</span><span>  ever  the  Jews  will  be  driven  out</span><span>  and  wherever  they  will  settle</span><span>  afresh  will  fructify  again  m  inkind</span><span>  for  the  benefit  of  the  human  race</span><span>  and  to  the  honour  of  the  Jewish</span></p> <p><span>  name.</span></p> "

For.  it</span><span>  arose  2,000  years  ago  among  sick,  ex</span><span>  hausted  and  despairing  men,  who  h^d</span><span>  lost,  their  belief  in  life,  \"who  had  des</span><span>  pised  .-the  world,  and  who  waited\"  for</span></p> <p><span>  the  return  of;  Christ  and  the  destruc-  j</span></p> <p><span>  tion  of  .  the  world.</span></p> <p><span>  .4.—The  German  religion  recognises</span><span>  no  dogma,  for  it  is  a  religion.'</span></p> <p><span>  5.—The  German  religion  is  not  a  re</span><span>  ligion  of  revelation  in  the  Christian</span><span>  sense,  \"  it  rests  rather  upon  a  natural</span><span>  revelation  ,of  the  Divine  forces  in  the</span><span>  world  and  in  the  human  mind.</span></p> <p><span>  6.—The  German  religion  is  the  re</span><span>  ligion  of  the  people.  It  has_nothing</span><span>  to  do\"  with  free  througlit,  atheist  pro</span><span>  paganda  and  the  ^disintegration</span><span>  (Zersetzung).  of  reigion.  We.  who  are</span><span>  genuine  .followers  of  German  religion</span><span>  talce  our  stand  on  the  basis  of  a  posi</span><span>  tive  religion.</span></p> <p><span>  Comments:—Where  Christianity</span><span>  stops,  there..our  religion,  begins.  Be</span></p> <p><span>  lief  in  a  personal  God,  in  revelation  ,</span><span>  and  salvation  is  all  superstition,  not</span><span>  religion.  The  biologically  educated</span><span>  man  ,  seeks  the  solution  of  his  moral</span><span>  and  religious  problems  in  the  Cosmos,</span></p> <p><span>  in  nature,-  and  the  world  of  reality,  in  .</span><span>  blood  and  soil,  people  and  home,  na-  j</span></p> <p><span>  tion  and  Fatherland.  Our  religion  is</span></p> <p><span>  no  longer  the  International  Christ-.j</span></p> <p><span>  God  which  could  not  -  prevent  Ver-  'j</span><span>  sailles.  *  Our  religion  isr\"-what  grows  I</span><span>  living  within  us>  the  great,  sacred,</span><span>  glowing  desire  to  wash  away  1,000</span><span>  years  of  German  sorrow,  and  make</span><span>  good  the  sins  of  the  Jewish-Christian</span><span>  alien  religion  against  the  German  soul.</span></p> <p><span>  7.—The  German  religion  is  riot  hos</span><span>  tile  to  a  church.  It  seeks  a  German</span><span>  church  on  the  basis  of  a  religious</span><span>  people.</span></p> <p><span>  8.—God  is  a  moral  idea  to  which  we</span><span>  are  bound  by  the  eternal  creative  force</span><span>  of  nature  which  works  in  the  world</span><span>  and  man.  Belief  in  another-worldly</span><span>  God  is  not  of  Indo-Germanic,  but  of</span><span>  Semitic  origin'.  This-kind  of  God-be</span><span>  lief  is  not  a  condition  of  true  religion</span><span>  and  piety</span></p> <p><span>  9.—In  the  lap  of  \"  the  divine,  living</span><span>  world  the  knowing  being  or  mind</span><span>  grows.  Mind,  is  a  natural  growth  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  .  world  of  reality.  It  is  not  a</span><span>  finished  thing  at  the  height  of  world</span></p> <p><span>  development.</span></p> <p><span>  10.—To  God's  being  belong  will,  un</span><span>  derstanding  (verstand)  and  personal</span><span>  ity.  These  are,  however,  unique  in</span><span>  man.  Hence  man'  is  the  place  (Ort)</span></p> <p><span>  of  God  in  the~  world.</span></p> <p><span>  -  11.—Man  is  not  God.  But  he  is</span><span>  God's  birthplace.  God  exists  and</span><span>  grows  in  man.  If  God  does  not  come</span><span>  in  man,  He  never  comes.  Hence  the</span><span>  German  religion  is  the  religion  of  high</span></p> <p><span>  faith  in  man.</span></p> <p><span>  12.—The  German  religion  recognises</span><span>  no  dualism  .or  conflict-  between  body</span><span>  and  soul,  any  more'than  duality  and</span><span>  conflict  between  God  and  the  world,</span><span>  and  God  and  man.  We  think  of  the</span><span>  being,  body-soul,  as  a  natural  unity</span><span>  and  entity.</span></p> <p><span>  Comments—\"Crucify  thy  flesh,\"</span><span>  was  the  demand  of  the  Esthetic  Chris</span><span>  tian  ethics  of  decadence,  which  over</span><span>  looked  that  at  the  same,  time  the  mind</span><span>  was  crucified.

                        "articleText": "<p><span>  GERMAN</span><span>  MORALE</span></p> <p><span>  One  of  the  most  encouraging  developments</span><span>  of  recent  weeks  has</span><span>  been  tne  increasing  reference  to  the</span><span>  decline  in  (iern.au  morale.  This  is</span><span>  not  the  result  of  wishful  thinking,</span><span>  or  even  inspired  comment  from</span><span>  neutral  sources  who  might  imagine</span><span>  that  we  are  anxious  to  hear  that</span><span>  German  morale  was  declining.  It</span><span>  comes  from  such  authoritative  a</span><span>  source  as  Dr.  Josef  Goebells  himself.</span><span>  Dr.  Goebells  does  not,  of  course,  refer</span><span>  to  it  in  so  many  words,  but  he</span><span>  does  refer  rather  significantly  to</span><span>  '  temporary  weakness,\"  and  he  reiterates</span><span>  with  monotonous  regularity</span><span>  the  fact  that  1918  \"was  a  unique  and</span><span>  tragic  event  in  our  history  which</span><span>  will  not,  and  cannot,  be  repeated.\"</span><span>  It  will  be  remembered  \"-iuuuuuicu  that  mat  in  his  nis</span><span>  ast</span><span>  Herr  Hitler  adopted  the</span><span>  same  lone,  and  very  obviously  the</span><span>  lears  of  1918  are  looming  very  large</span><span>  on  the  German  canvas.  As  a  matter</span><span>  of  fact,  the  differences  between  the</span><span>  present  time  and  1918  are  not  so</span><span>  very  marked.  At  this  stage  of  the</span><span>  last  war,  both  Turkey  and  Bulgaria</span><span>  had  been  forced  out  rather  in  the</span><span>  same  way  as  Italy  has  been  forced</span><span>  out  this  time.  The  crippling  defeats</span><span>  which  the  German  army  is  suffering</span><span>  on  the  eastern  front  were  being  emulated</span><span>  on  the  western  front  of  the</span><span>  last  war.  And  to  this  similarity</span><span>  must  be  added  the  increasing  cost</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  U-boat  campaign,  which</span><span>  is,</span><span>  ,  lor  all  practical  purposes,  as  great</span><span>  a  failure</span><span>  loday</span><span>  as  it  was</span><span>  at</span><span>  the</span><span>  beginning,  of  1918.</span><span>  But  there  is  another</span><span>  and  very  important  difference</span><span>  in</span><span>  the</span><span>  situation—tiie</span><span>  first,</span><span>  which</span><span>  favours</span><span>  the  United  Nations,  is</span><span>  the</span><span>  fact  that  Germany</span><span>  is  being  iiit</span><span>  far</span><span>  harder</span><span>  from  the  air  than  was  possible</span><span>  during  the  last  war.</span><span>  The  second,</span><span>  winch  is  in  favour  of  Germany</span><span>  is</span><span>  the  fact</span><span>  that  the  Nazis  have</span><span>  a</span><span>  much  more  stringent  and  brutal  dis-</span><span>  *  lpunc</span><span>  of</span><span>  the</span><span>  civilian</span><span>  population</span><span>  than  did  the  Kaiser's  Government  of</span><span>  Lie</span><span>  last</span><span>  war.</span><span>  Consequently,</span><span>  u</span><span>  would</span><span>  be  foolish</span><span>  to  anticipate</span><span>  au</span><span>  iitinn  diate  earl  j  collapse  of  the  Cer</span><span>  mans,  although  this  is  by  no  means</span><span>  impossible.</span><span>  It</span><span>  must</span><span>  not,</span><span>  however,</span><span>  be  expected.</span><span>  At  the  same  time  it  looks  very</span><span>  much  as  though  the  German  leaders</span><span>  themselves  are  not  too  hopeful.  This</span><span>  constant  reiteration  of  PJLS  is  an</span><span>  indication  of  how  much  it  is  preying</span><span>  on  their  minds.

But,  within  those</span><span>  limits,  a  self-governing  Ger?jp</span><span>  State  has  been  brought  into</span><span>  being  by  the  Western  Powers.</span><span>  It  is  a  fateful  experiment.  The</span><span>  willingness  and  capacity  of  the</span><span>  German  people  to  make  a  re</span><span>  presentative  parliamentary  sys</span><span>  tem  work,  which  has  already</span><span>  failed  once  in  the  destruction  of</span><span>  the  Weimar  Republic  by  Hitler's</span><span>  Nazism,  is  again  being  put  to</span><span>  the  test  in  a  very  difficult  post</span><span>  war  stage.  The  outcome,</span><span>  politically  and  economically,</span><span>  will  have  a  profound  influence</span><span>  on  the  future  of  Europe  and</span><span>  the  task  of  Dr.  Adenauer  as</span><span>  the  first  Chancellor,  is  one  of</span><span>  the  gravest  responsibility.  The</span><span>  return  of  germany  to  a  proper</span><span>  place  in  the  European  and</span><span>  world  community  has  been</span><span>  facilitated  by  the  Western</span><span>  Powers.  But  there  will  be  need</span><span>  for  sound  evidence  of  German</span><span>  attachment  to  peaceable  demo</span><span>  cratic  practice  and  of  a  genu</span><span>  inely  cooperative  spirit  to</span><span>  justify  the  next  step,  which</span><span>  would  presumably  be  admis</span><span>  sion  to  the  Council  of  Europe.</span><span>  The  greatest  danger,  as  always</span><span>  in  German  politics,  must  come</span><span>  from  the  lack  of  any  ingrained</span><span>  parliamentary  tradition  and  the</span><span>  struggle  of  extremists  on  the</span><span>  right  and  the  left  to  overthrow</span><span>  the  moderate  democrats  and</span><span>  seize  authoritarian  power.  A</span><span>  stabilising  factor,  however,  is</span><span>  that  the  two  major  parties-the</span><span>  Christian  Democrats  in  office</span><span>  and  the  Social  Democrats  in</span><span>  opposition-stand  firmly  for</span><span>  constitutional  and  democratic</span><span>  principles.  The  Christian</span><span>  Democrats,  although  the  larg</span><span>  est  party  in  the  Federal  Lower</span><span>  House,  have  only  139  seats  out</span><span>  of  402.  Under  Dr.  Aden</span><span>  auer's  leadership  they  de</span><span>  clined  to  seek  a  Government</span><span>  with  the  Social  Democrats  (131</span><span>  seats)  because  of  deep  divisions</span><span>  on  economic  policy.  Dr.  Aden</span><span>  auer  therefore  looked  to  the</span><span>  smaller  parties  on  his  right</span><span>  and  he  has  formed  a  coalition</span><span>  with  the  conservative  .  Free</span><span>  Democrats  and  the  strongly</span><span>  nationalist  German  Party.  It</span><span>  is  a  coalition,  however,  which</span><span>  has  an  extremely  narrow  ma</span><span>  jority.  Dr.  Adenauer's  pro</span><span>  blem,  in  which  the  Western</span><span>  Powers  have  an  acute  and  ap</span><span>  prehensive  interest,  will  be  to</span><span>  resist  dictation  from  the  right</span><span>  and  to  hold  in  check  the  re</span><span>  vival  of  nationalism  which  was</span><span>  so  strongly  marked  in  the  elec</span><span>  tion.</span></p> "

This  is  an  import</span><span>  ant  factor  to  be  reckoned  with</span><span>  in  the  urgent  and  complex</span><span>  problem  of  revitalising  food</span><span>  production.  Even  if  Britain</span><span>  were  not  herself  engaged  in  a</span><span>  vigorous  drive  for  more  out</span><span>  put  from  the  land,  the  com</span><span>  petition  from  other  overseas</span><span>  countries  is  such  that  Austra</span><span>  lia  would  still  have  to  turn  to</span><span>  Europe  for  agricultural  mi</span><span>  grants.  There,  too,  post-war</span><span>  rehabilitation  has  reduced  the</span><span>  small  proportion  which  farm</span><span>  workers  represent  in  the</span><span>  pool  of  potential  migrants.</span><span>  But  there  is  a  surplus  of</span><span>  landless  farming  people  in</span><span>  West  Germany  for  special  rea</span><span>  sons  emphasised  by  the  mem</span><span>  bers  of  the  West  German</span><span>  Federal  Migration  Board  now</span><span>  visiting  Western  Australia  on</span><span>  an  exploratory  mission.  The</span><span>  Commonwealth  Govern</span><span>  ment's  move  towards  accept</span><span>  ance  of  a  quota  of  selec</span><span>  ted  Germans  under  a  negotia</span><span>  ted  migration  agreement</span><span>  like  that  with  Italy-gives</span><span>  Australia  a  chance  to  recruit</span><span>  agricultural  workers.  For</span><span>  West  Germany  it  offers  some</span><span>  relief  in  the  problem  of  pro</span><span>  viding  for  an  influx  of  nearly</span><span>  10,000,000  people  who  are</span><span>  either  victims  of  Communist</span><span>  expulsion  from  the  Russian</span><span>  dominated  territories  or  fugi</span><span>  tives  from  Communist  terror.</span><span>  Nothing  but  prejudice  need</span><span>  stand  in  the  way  of  working</span><span>  out  an  arrangement  for</span><span>  mutual  advantage.</span><span>  If  we  have  to  go  outside</span><span>  Britain  for  population  we</span><span>  naturally  look  first  along  the</span><span>  Western  European  seaboard</span><span>  for  assimilable  racial  stock</span><span>  most  akin  to  our  own.  In</span><span>  the  aftermath  of  the  war</span><span>  there  have  been  great  changes</span><span>  in  Germany  and  also  in  the</span><span>  Western  attitude  to  the  Ger</span><span>  man  people  and  their  future</span><span>  in  the  free  world.  An  at</span><span>  tempt  is  being  made  to  build</span><span>  up  a  friendly  and  peaceful</span><span>  cooperation  and,  at  the  same</span><span>  time,  circumstances  have  pro</span><span>  duced  a  new  period  of  Ger</span><span>  man  readiness  to  migrate.  In</span><span>  South  Australia,  particularly,</span><span>  there  is  experience  of  how  an</span><span>  earlier  generation  of  German</span><span>  settlers  showed  a  capacity  to</span><span>  identify  themselves  with  the</span><span>  life  and  institutions  of  their</span><span>  adopted  country.</span><span>  Any  German  migration  now</span><span>  could  amount  to  only  a  micro</span><span>  scopic  percentage  of  the</span><span>  Australian  population  and,</span><span>  should  any  political  or  other</span><span>  undesirables  slip  through  the</span><span>  screen,  they  could  always</span><span>  be  sent  back  on  proof  of</span><span>  subversion  or  misconduct.</span><span>  There  would  be  no  need  for</span><span>  costly  land  settlement  ven</span><span>  tures.  Concentration  on  Ger</span><span>  man  farmers  or  farm-workers</span><span>  willing  to  take  agricultural</span><span>  jobs-perhaps  under  some</span><span>  limited  contract-would  im</span><span>  pose  a  minimum  strain  on</span><span>  housing.  Employed  on  farms</span><span>  they  could  gain  experience</span><span>  of  Australian  conditions  and</span><span>  work  towards  small  farms  of</span><span>  their  own.</span></p> "

I  ieaVn</span><span>  afterwards  that  hardly  a  single  Ger</span><span>  man  Jew  had  attended  during  thi</span><span>  more  than  ten  days  it  was  open.  ]</span><span>  look  back  upon  more  than  fifteet</span><span>  years  since  the  first  immigration  o|</span><span>  the  refugees  from  Germany  and  |</span><span>  cannot  help  feeling  some  regret  that</span><span>  these  potentially  valuable  elements  djj</span><span>  not  in  fact  play  a  greater  part  in  om</span><span>  development.  What  was  the  reason!</span><span>  Was  it  their  apathy  or  opr  failure  t?</span><span>  give  them  the  proper  encouragement!</span><span>  Surely  both  factors  operated.  Bui</span><span>  in  just  what  proportions  it  is  not  easy</span><span>  to  say.  Argument  on  the'  subject  can</span><span>  continue  endlessly.  You  will  find</span><span>  some  people  who  will  tell  you  that  the</span><span>  assimilation  for  which  German  Jews</span><span>  were  notorious  will  always  make</span><span>  them  indifferent  to  the  community’s</span><span>  problems.  But  against  this  it  is  pos</span><span>  sible  to  cite  many  examples  of  devoted</span><span>  Jewish  service  by  German  Jews.  The</span><span>  argument  to-day  ought  to  be  directed</span><span>  differently.  It  should  be  aimed  at</span><span>  enlisting  the  service  of  this  valuable</span><span>  section  into  active  work  for  the  com</span><span>  munity.  1  don’t  share  .the  view  of  the</span><span>  pessimists.  Given  the  right  approach</span><span>  we  coiild  recrpit  4  powerful  force  into</span><span>  our  rapjcs.</span></p> "

The  world’s  press  has</span><span>  given,  over  much  space  to  comment</span><span>  on  Dr.  Adenauer’s  plea  that  Ger</span><span>  many  should  be  strengthened  again</span><span>  to  serve  as  a  buffer  between  the</span><span>  West  and  Russia.  Somewhat  less</span><span>  space  to  these  important  matters  has</span><span>  been  given  in  the  Australian  news</span><span>  papers  where  pre-occupation  with</span><span>  other  issues  has  crowded  the  German</span><span>  news  out.

The  Christian</span><span>  Science  Monitor  said  that  to  rearm</span><span>  Germany  would  simply  place  in  Ger</span><span>  man  hands  the  balance  of  power  in</span><span>  Europe,  an  arrangement  which  might</span><span>  suit  diabolical  German  plans  very</span><span>  well,  but  which  would  effectively</span><span>  destroy  any  prospect  of  world  peace.</span><span>  The  warnings  against  these  German</span><span>  manoeuvres  must  be  sounded  from</span><span>  one  end  of  the  world  to  the  other.</span><span>  Germany  still  remains  the  greatest</span><span>  menace  to  world  peace,  said  Lord</span><span>  Wavell,  whose  lamented  death  oc</span><span>  curred  only  a  fortnight  ago.

In  less  than  a</span><span>  decade  the  probability  has  arisen  of  a  sovereign</span><span>  Germany  becoming  a  member  of  the  North  Atlantic</span><span>  Treaty  Organisation  and  a  full  ally  of  the  West.</span><span>  Reports  of  the  revival  of  Nazism  in  high  places  in</span><span>  West  Germany  are  among  the  reasons  why  the</span><span>  West  as  well  as  Russia  should  feel  far  from  happy</span><span>  about  this  probability.</span><span>  Russia  has  proposed  another  meeting  to  dis-</span></p> <p><span>  cuss  European  security  and  the  future  of  Germany.</span><span>  Britain  and  America  are  said  to  favour  rejection</span><span>  of  this  proposal,  but  the  French  Premier  (M.</span><span>  Mendes-France)  is  understood  to  wish  the  door,  to</span><span>  be  kept  open.

Only  the  weak</span><span>  need  fear  war,  the  strong</span><span>  have  no  fear,  by  the  mere  fact</span><span>  that  they  are  strong.  To  ex</span><span>  perience  war—  in  the  deepest</span><span>  sense  of  this  much  used  word</span><span>  —  is  a  joy  and  a  pleasure.'</span><span>  The  changing  attitude  of  the</span><span>  Germans  as  the  war  progress</span><span>  ed  was  clearly  noticeable  —  I</span><span>  exclude,  of  course,  the  SS  and</span><span>  the  Gestapo  —  and  their  fear</span><span>  of  the  Russians  was  most</span><span>  pronounced.  It  is  hard  to  say</span><span>  to  what  extent  they  were  be</span><span>  hind  the  Hitler  regime  —  the</span><span>  majority  were,  of  course,  de</span><span>  laying  that  they  were  ever</span><span>  good  Nazis  at  the  war's  end.</span><span>  But  I  strongly  suspect  that</span><span>  they  were  reasonably  ardent</span><span>  supporters  of  the  regime  af</span><span>  ter  the  earlier  victories  of</span><span>  1940.  With  most  people,  after</span><span>  all,  results  alone  count.  At</span><span>  least  one  German  of  my  ac</span><span>  quaintance,  was  pessimistic</span><span>  enough  to  sing  in  the  compa</span><span>  rative  safety  of  our  .barrack</span><span>  washroom  'Deutschland  ist</span><span>  kaput'  in  early  1944.  On  the</span><span>  whole  the  Luftwaffe  treatoi</span><span>  us  fairly  and  adhered  to  the</span><span>  Geneva  Convention.  The  two</span><span>  air  forces  had  a  mutual  re</span><span>  spect  for  each  other  and  the</span><span>  average  German  civilian,  at</span><span>  least  in  the  country  centres,</span><span>  was  not  as  antagonistic  to</span></p> <p><span>  wards  air  crew,  particularly</span><span>  bomber  command,  as  we</span><span>  might  have  expected.  It  was</span><span>  a  different  story  in  the  larger</span><span>  cities,  especially  the  target</span><span>  area,  but  that  is  understan</span><span>  dable.</span><span>  To  conclude  I  would  like  to</span><span>  quote^rom  Winston  Church</span><span>  ill's  book,  'My  Early  Life.'</span><span>  'Prisoner  of  War—  that  is</span><span>  the  least  unfortunate  kind  of</span><span>  prisoner  to  be,  but  it  is  ne</span><span>  vertheless  a  melancholy  state.</span><span>  You  are  in  the  power  of  your</span><span>  enemy.

Meanwhile,  the  war  is</span><span>  going  on,  great  events  are  in</span></p> <p><span>  progress,  fine  opportunities</span><span>  for  action  and  adventure  are</span><span>  slipping  away.  Also,  the  days</span><span>  are  very  long.  Hours  crawl</span><span>  like  paralytic  centipedes.  No</span><span>  thing  amuses  you.  Reading  is</span><span>  difficult;  writing  impossible.</span><span>  Life  is  one  long  boredom  from</span><span>  ('awn  till  slumber.  Moreover,</span><span>  the  whole  atmosphere  of  pri</span><span>  son,  even  the  most  easy  and</span><span>  best  regulated  prison,  is  od</span><span>  ious.  Companions  in  this  kind</span><span>  of  misfortune  quarrel  about</span><span>  trifles  and  get  the  least  pos</span><span>  sible  pleasure  from  each  oth</span><span>  er's  society.  If  you  have  never</span><span>  been  under  restraint  before</span><span>  and  never  known  what  it  is</span><span>  to  be  a  captive,  you  feel  a</span><span>  sense  of  constant  humiliation</span><span>  in  being  confined  to  a  narrow</span><span>  space,  fenced  in  by  wire,  wat</span><span>  ched  ,by  armed'men  and  web</span><span>  bed  in  by  a  tangle  of  regula</span><span>  tions.  I  certainly  hated  every</span><span>  minute  of  my  captivity  more</span><span>  than  I  hated  any  other  period</span><span>  in  my  whole  life  .  .  .  looking</span><span>  back  on  those  days  I  have  al</span><span>  ways  felt  the  keenest  pity</span><span>  for  prisoners  and  captives.'  -</span></p> "
