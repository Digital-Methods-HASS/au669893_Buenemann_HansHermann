                        "articleText": "<p><span>  GERMAN  SPEEADEAGLEISM.</span></p> <p><span>  A  prominent  German  newspaper  baa</span><span>  opened  oat  with,  another  hysterical</span><span>  tirade  against  Great  Britain.  This  in</span><span>  stance  of  spread-eagleism  might  well</span><span>  be  dismissed,  as  others  have  been,  but</span><span>  that  it  acquires  special  significance</span></p> <p><span>  from  tbe  fact  that  the  journal  in</span><span>  which  it  appears  is  frequently  the</span><span>  mouthpiece  of  the  Government  —  which</span><span>  in  international  affairs  really  means</span><span>  the  impetuous,  ambitious  Kaiser  —  and</span><span>  touches  upon  tbe  vital  question  of  what</span><span>  Power  really  controls  the  destiny  of</span><span>  European  politics.  Great  Britain  is</span><span>  warned  not  to  provoke  a  decision  on</span><span>  the  subject,  because  of  the  world</span><span>  wide  significance  and  effect  attaching</span><span>  to  it.  In  other  words  Germany  infer</span><span>  entially  threatens  that  if  the  issue  is</span></p> <p><span>  provoked  Bhe  will  contest  any  decision</span><span>  adverse  to  her  aspirations  in  that  con</span><span>  nection.  Tbe  greatest  of  the  Kaiser's</span><span>  many  ambitions  is  unquestionably  that</span><span>  Germany  should  gain  that  indefinite,</span><span>  yet  all  important,  quality  known  as</span><span>  the  '  balance  of  power.'  Every  move</span><span>  in  policy,  every  increase  of  the  navy</span><span>  and  the  army  is  conceived  with  that</span><span>  objective  in  view;  it  is  almost,  if  not</span><span>  quite,  an  obsession  with  the  Monarch.</span><span>  How  far  this  spirit  and  the  prepara</span><span>  tions  which  How  from  it  can  ba  effec</span></p> <p><span>  tive,  must  remain  iu  uuuoi  uum  ??</span><span>  test  has  been  applied.  In  tbe  interim</span><span>  Germany  remains  the  cause  of  unrest</span><span>  amongst  the  nations,  and  because</span><span>  of  her  strenuousnesss  in  almost</span><span>  every  part  of  the  world  has</span><span>  to  be  closely  watched,  even  by</span><span>  the  smaller  powers.  It  can  well  be</span><span>  understood  that  a  nation  with  such</span><span>  ambitions  as  Germany  has  chafes</span><span>  under  the  '  diplomatic  net  '  which</span><span>  has  been  woven  around  her,  and  for</span><span>  which  Great  Britain  has  to  thank  the</span><span>  late  Lord  Salisbury,  whose  apprecia</span><span>  tion  of  the  importance  of  the  Empire's</span><span>  relations  with  the  other  Powers  has</span><span>  resulted  in  the  creation  of  what  is  ad</span><span>  mitted  to  be  the  ablest  diplomatic</span><span>  service  in  the  world.  That  service</span><span>  has  unquestionably  checkmated  Ger</span><span>  many,  maintained  Great  Britain's</span></p> <p><span>  prestige  and,  by  .the  intervening  of</span><span>  interests,  made  her  position  more</span><span>  secure  and  yet  left  an  outlet  for.  the</span><span>  policy  of  'grand  isolation'  which</span><span>  Lord  Salisbury  considered  so  essential</span><span>  to  her  supremacy.  Germany  may  at</span><span>  tempt  to  capture  the  '  balance  of</span><span>  power  '  by  a  revolt  against  the  tight</span><span>  ening  cordon  of  diplomacy,  tbe  con</span><span>  tinued  increase  -of  her  naval  and  mer</span><span>  cantile  fleets,  and  her  army.  Bat</span><span>  how  long  could  such  an  aggressive</span><span>  nation,  inclined  to  riding  rough-shod</span><span>  over  obstacles,  maintain  that  power</span><span>  when  in  the  high  stirrups,  assuming</span><span>  that  altitude  was  attained  9  Not  for</span><span>  long,  we  believe.  So  long  as  Great</span></p> <p><span>  Britain  maintains  the  two-power  de</span><span>  fence,  the  balance  of  power  is  likely  to</span><span>  remain  with  her.  But  at  Germany's</span><span>  rate  of  battleship  construction  that</span><span>  position  is  being  jeopardised.  It  is</span><span>  probably  Great  Britain's  realisation  of</span><span>  that  fact  which  the  German  semi</span><span>  official  newspaper  regards  as  provoca</span><span>  tion  for  testing  the  issue  of  supre</span><span>  macy,  and  for  the  spreadeaglelsm  in</span><span>  which  it  indulges  with  reference  to  tbe</span><span>  capabilities  of  the  army.  Though</span><span>  hysterical,  however,  the  declaration,</span><span>  emanating  from  what  is  frequently</span><span>  the  mouth-piece  of  the  Government,</span><span>  may  or  may  not  have  official  founda</span><span>  tion  ;  at  any  rate  it  is  worth  noticing.</span></p> "

Compared  with  1906,  all  sources  of</span><span>  revenue,  except  two  show  increases,  as,  for  instance,</span><span>  Customs  duties,  643,000,000  marks,  or  88,400,000  marks</span><span>  more  than  during  the  previous  year.  Tobacco  and  cigar-</span></p> <p><span>  ettes  excise  duties  23,600,000  marks,  or  7,000,000  marks</span><span>  more,  distilled  excise  duties  112,600,000  marks,  or</span><span>  7,800,000  marks  more,  brewing  excise  duties  51,100,000</span><span>  marks,  or  8,200,000  marks  more,  etc.  The  two  excep-</span><span>  tions  referred  to  are  the  stamp  duties  on  revenue-pro-</span><span>  ducing  stocks  and  on  Bourse  transactions,  which  together</span></p> <p><span>  yielded  22,900,000  marks  less  than  in  1906.  But  against</span><span>  this  it  should  be  remembered  that  they  had  been  un-</span><span>  naturally  high  during  that  year.  All  other  sources</span><span>  of  revenue  together  show  an  increase  of  160,000,000</span><span>  marks  in  round  figures,  so  that  if  we  deduct  the  lesser</span><span>  yield  of  the  Bourse  transactions,  there  still  remains  for</span><span>  1907  an  excess  of  revenue  of  137,000,000  marks  in  round</span><span>  figures  as  compared  to  the  previous  year.  Moreover,</span><span>  the  fact  should  not  be  lost  sight  of  that  of  the  new</span><span>  duties  passed  in  1906,  obviously  none  were  able  to</span><span>  yield  their  full  measure  of  revenue  in  1907.  This  will</span><span>  only  be  the  case  in  1910,  and  not  before.  This  much,</span><span>  however,  may  safely  be  predicted—that  the  expecta-</span><span>  tions  which  led  to  the  imposition  of  the  new  duties</span><span>  will  be  fully  justified;  in  fact,  in  some  instances,  the</span><span>  yield  has  already  come  up  to  the  estimates.</span></p> "

He</span><span>  says  :  'j[  believe  an  extraordinary  situa</span><span>  tion  ihas  been  created,  and  that  hence</span><span>  forward,  if  Germany  so  will  and  can</span><span>  find  the  money,  the  two-Power  '  stand</span><span>  ard  of  the  Britisk  Fleet,  accepted  by</span><span>  Liverals  as  well  as  Conservatives,  can</span><span>  not  be  maintained.  .  -  Few  persons</span><span>  realise  what  the  appearance  of  such  a</span><span>  navy  as  that  which  Germany  is  build</span><span>  ing  means  in  international  affairs.

The  question  is:  What</span><span>  will  she  be  able  to  do  with  such  a</span><span>  force?  That  is  her  meaning:  the</span><span>  expediency  of  an  unknown  future,  as</span><span>  yet  contingent,  and  impossible  to  fore</span><span>  see.

In  'The  United  Service</span><span>  Gazette'  Captain  E.  H.

I  heard  the  German</span><span>  people  talking  peace  a  month  after</span><span>  the  outbreak  of  war—of  a  peace</span></p> <p><span>  to  be  sure  which  Germany  would</span><span>  dictate  and  keep.  When  the</span><span>  Fatherland  was  winning  I  heard  no</span><span>  discordant  note.

The</span><span>  great  captains  of  industry  who  con-</span><span>  trol  the  party  believe  in  the  em-</span><span>  ployment  of  the  German  Army  and</span><span>  Navy  to  further  their  ends  —  i.e.,  to</span><span>  secure  permanently  for  Germany</span></p> <p><span>  the  mining  regions  of  Northern</span><span>  France  and  the  coal  and  shipping</span><span>  of  Belgium  ;  and  to  cripple  rival</span><span>  commerce,  not  only  as  a  means  of</span><span>  winning  the  war,  but  also  of  limit-</span><span>  ing  competition  against  them  after</span><span>  wards.  These  are  the  men  behind</span><span>  Tirpitz,  and  they  are  working,  and</span><span>  will  continue  to  work,  to  restore</span><span>  him  to  power.</span><span>  Dr  Stresemann,  one  of  the  most</span><span>  influential  National  Liberals,  is  a</span><span>  dynamo  of  energy  in  German  com-</span><span>  mercial  plans.  His  eyes  sparkling</span><span>  with  zeal,  reddish  hair,  a  clear,</span><span>  metallic  voice,  he  is  a  heavy  man</span><span>  physically,  wielding  a  tremendous</span><span>  and  growing  power  in  Germany  to-</span><span>  day.  He  has  a  controlling  interest</span><span>  in  a  recently  organised  combination</span><span>  of  some  two  thousand  manufactur-</span><span>  ing  firms,  and  is  practically  dictator</span><span>  of  the  Sachsische  Handelsgesell-</span><span>  schaft  and  the  Deutsch-Amerikan-</span><span>  ische  Wirthschaftsverband.</span><span>  He  became  one  of  theChancellor's</span><span>  most  out-spoken  enemies  at  the</span></p> <p><span>  time  of  the  Danish  concessions  to</span><span>  America,  and  his  fiery  advocacy  of</span><span>  relentless  submarine  warfare  has</span><span>  earned  him  a  reputation  for  fright-</span><span>  fulness,  even  in  Germany.  He  be-</span><span>  longs  to  the  Western  School  of  pre-</span><span>  sent-day  Germany  —  the  school</span><span>  which  believes  in  placating  Russia</span><span>  (to  be  followed  by  a  peaceful  pene-</span><span>  tration  of  that  country)  and  the</span><span>  smashing  as  far  as  possible  of</span><span>  Britain  and  France.  As  his  utter-</span><span>  ances  in  the  Reichstag  plainly  show,</span><span>  he  is  passionately  anti-American  in</span><span>  general  and  anti-Wilson  in  par-</span><span>  ticular.</span><span>  Since  he  is  one  of  the  foremost</span><span>  Germans  in  the  great  campaign</span><span>  against  Great  Britain  both  during</span><span>  and  after  the  war,  Dr  Stresemann's</span><span>  views  should  be  of  particular  in-</span><span>  terest.  His  most  recent  utterances</span><span>  agree  in  the  main  with  those  he</span><span>  made  in  an  interview  which  he  gave</span><span>  me,  and  which  I  duly  communi-</span><span>  cated  to  American  newspapers</span><span>  through  the  Wilhelmstrasse.  There</span><span>  are,  however,  some  important  dif-</span><span>  ferences  which  I  shall  point  out</span></p> <p><span>  later.</span><span>  \"How  seriously  do  German  in-</span><span>  dustrial  circles  regard  the  Paris</span><span>  Economic  Conference?\"  was  the</span><span>  first  question  I  put  to  Dr  Strese-</span><span>  mann.</span><span>  \"If  one  is  to  attach  great  import-</span><span>  ance  to  the  words  of  the  political</span><span>  economists  of  the  Entente,\"  he  be-</span><span>  gan,  \"then  we  must  agree  that  we</span><span>  might  have  considerable  anxiety</span><span>  and  alarm  about  our  industrial  fut-</span><span>  ure;  but,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  Ger-</span><span>  man  industrial  circles  view  these</span><span>  endeavors  of  our  enemies  with  calm-</span><span>  ness  of  indifference.</span><span>  \"Russia  cannot  emancipate  her-</span><span>  self  from  German  industry.

Had</span><span>  there  never  been  a  great  Empire  of  Germany,</span><span>  then  possibly  there  would  now  be  a</span><span>  great  German  Empire.  We  want  to  realise</span><span>  that  the  old  German  Empire  was  one</span><span>  made  up  of  nations,  and  that  some  of</span><span>  these  did  great  pioneerlng  work  which</span><span>  circumstances  linked  with  their  individual</span><span>  selves.  If  Australia  were  to  take  all</span><span>  New  Guinea,  and  England  approved,  it</span><span>  would  be  an  Imperial  work,  and  our  language</span><span>  being  the  same,  the  latter  would</span><span>  stand  even  though  ultimately  we  separated.</span><span>  Some  of  the  work  of  Spain  was  done</span><span>  as  part  of  the  old  German  Empire:  that</span><span>  is  to  say,  the  King  of  Spain  was  also  the</span><span>  German  Emperor.  The  old  German  Empire</span><span>  came  too  soon  in  last,  albeit  it  did  last</span></p> <p><span>  in  one  form  and  another  for  ages.  Permanent</span><span>  Empire  is  dependent  on  rapid</span><span>  transit  and  quick  intercommunications.</span><span>  Without  the  stcemboat  and  the  telegraph,</span><span>  and  also  railways  in  conjunction,  the  present</span><span>  British  Empire  would  be  as  impossible</span><span>  as  was  the  former  one.  1t  is  forgotten</span><span>  that  there  was  an  Anglo-French</span><span>  Empire,  even  though  not  that  the  thirteen</span><span>  American  Colonies  dissolved,  the</span><span>  Anglo-American  one  to  the  extent  that</span><span>  they  were  responsible  for  the  title.  German</span><span>  is  the  vernacular  of  a  territorially</span><span>  small  section  of  the  world's  surface.  It</span><span>  is  filled  in  solid  in  the  little  map.  German</span><span>  is  read  or  spoken  to  some  extent  in</span><span>  the  shaded  sections,  for  the  following  reasons—</span><span>  in  parts  through  old  control  and</span><span>  the  continued  virility  and  influence  of  the</span><span>  strain,  and  over  all  through  present  Germany's</span><span>  commercial  and  flinancial  relatlonships.</span><span>  To  these  we  may  add  strain  derivations,</span><span>  no  matter  of  what  date,  and  the</span><span>  face  that  German  has  been  responsible</span><span>  for  a  great  literature.  Nevertheless  partial</span><span>  use  is  not  sufficient.  Partial  use</span><span>  in  Germany's  case  means  that  in  many</span><span>  spheres  the  language  is  merely  classical.</span><span>  There  is  no  domain  for  the  vernacular  to</span><span>  establish  itself  outside  of  Europe  and</span><span>  spread.</span></p> "

It</span><span>  is  hardly  likely,  of  cource,  that  there</span><span>  will  be  any  immediate  change  of  Gcr.</span><span>  man  Dolicy.  Even  the  supporters  of  the</span><span>  now  President,  Jubilant  as  they  must</span><span>  be,  would  not  dare  to  take  the  jisk  of</span><span>  provoking  civil  war.  At  the  same  time</span><span>  the  victory  of  HiIndenburg,  who  is  tihe</span><span>  figurehead  of  the  Monarchists,  is  sug</span><span>  gestive  of  the  growing  strength  of  that</span><span>  element  which  would  turn  thle  military</span><span>  defeat  of  the  Great  War  Into  a  diplo</span><span>  matic  success,  or  at  least  a  draw  with</span><span>  out  penalties.  There  was  a  time  when</span><span>  the  aged  marshal's  name  was  one  to</span><span>  conjure  with.,  iHe  was  the  Idol  of  a</span><span>  deluded  people,  but  when  the  \"im</span><span>  pregnable\"  imne  which  bore  his  name</span><span>  was  broken,  when  the  Australlans</span><span>  participated  in  the  smashing  blow</span><span>  that  crumpled  up  his  armies,  ficktle</span><span>  fame  deserted  him.  Since  then  he  Ilas</span><span>  tasted  the  sorrows  as  well  as  the</span><span>  sweets  of  public  eminence.  A  hero  and</span><span>  a  butt,  a  national  saviour  and  a  na</span></p> <p><span>  tional  scapegoat,  a  great  soldier  to</span><span>  whom  a  war  fired  people  paid  bound</span><span>  less  homage,.  and  a  reputed  failure</span><span>  bowed  down  beneath  popular  derision,</span><span>  all  these  vagaries  Von  Hindenburg  has</span><span>  experienced:  and  now  he  has  emerged</span><span>  from  obsburity  into  triumph.  He  has</span><span>  becomen  the  leader  of  tile  German  na</span><span>  tion  with.  power  to  mould  its  progress</span><span>  to  his  will.</span><span>  Through  all  the  conflict  of  opinion</span><span>  that  filters  through  the  calbles  it  is</span><span>  difficult  to  gauge  with  any  degree  of</span><span>  accuracy  the  trend  of  th'ought  in  Ger</span><span>  many.  Tile  statements  the  new  PrCs</span><span>  dent  has  m'ale  frops  time  to  tintme</span><span>  have  in  them  the  elements  of  confu</span><span>  sion;  but  it  seems  reasonably  certain</span><span>  that  the  nation  as  a  whole  is  by  no</span><span>  means  irrevocably  coninitted  to'  tile</span><span>  republican  form  of  government.  Nor  is</span><span>  there  .any  sound  ground  for  believing</span><span>  that  .the  nation  Is  prepared  tio  accept</span><span>  the  consequences  of  the  d~feat  of  her</span><span>  reckless  bid  for  world  power.  It  has</span><span>  been  well  sald  thatthere  is  no  sign  of</span><span>  'disarmament  of  the  intellect  in  Ger</span><span>  many,\"  and  the  Allied  Military  Mis</span><span>  sion  has  discovered  disturbing  signs</span><span>  of  purposeful  evasion  of  treaty  obliga</span><span>  tions.  The  same  spirit  has  been  en</span><span>  countered  in  other  directions.  The</span><span>  schemes  of  successive  governments  to</span><span>  outwit  theAllies  and  hscape  financial</span><span>  burdens  ruined  tile  countr.y's  .cur</span><span>  rency'and  shattered  its  credit.  Sonme</span><span>  months  ago  we  pointed  out  that  *  the</span><span>  trouble  seems  to  be  the  persistence  of</span><span>  tile  Prusslan  military  caste,  backed  by</span><span>  the  war  profiteers  and  imperiallaistic</span><span>  intellectuals.  German  democracy  is</span><span>  being  trampled  upon  by  thle  wcr  lords,</span><span>  and  there  is  little  prospect  of  real</span><span>  peace  until  the  yoke  of  the  Juinkers</span><span>  has  been  removed  front  their  necks.</span><span>  There  is  dome  consolation.  in  the</span><span>  knowledge  that  the  Republican  vote  is</span><span>  still  a  force  to  be  reckoned  with  in  tile</span><span>  constituencieo.  In  tfact  some  of  tihe</span><span>  election  figures  which  have  just  been</span><span>  published  suggest  that  there  are  more</span><span>  Republicans  thaAl  Monarchists.  and</span><span>  whether  their  preference  for  Dr.  Marx</span><span>  indicated  a  belief  that  the  Replublican</span><span>  form  of  gpvernment  was  the  ideal,  or</span><span>  merely  the  best  expedient  for  mollify</span><span>  ing  publlec  opinion  in  othler  countries,</span><span>  tile  result  is  much  thle  same.

A  crisis  has  now  been  reached  with  the  refusal  of  Germany,</span><span>  through  the  mouth  of  Dr.  Schacht  (president  of  the  Reichsbank),</span><span>  to  pay  interest  or  any  proportion  of  interest  upon  her  debts,  includ</span><span>  ing  the  Dawes  and  Young  loans.  This  step  amounts  to  repudiation.</span><span>  The  requests,  polite  enough  in  all  conscience,  of  the  British  and</span><span>  French  Governments  for  further  information  on  the  situation,  are</span><span>  declared  by  the  Nazi  organs  to  be.  'mere  bluff'  and  the  principal</span><span>  Nazi  newspaper  states  that,  should  England  take  any  active  steps</span><span>  against  Germany  in  regard  to  these  debts,  Germany  would  'retaliate</span><span>  against  the  whole  British  Empire  which  sells  considerably  more  to</span><span>  Germany  than  it  buys  from  her'.</span><span>  'Whilst  it  may  be  true  that  Germany  buys  more  from  the  British</span><span>  Empire  than  that  Empire  buys  from  her,  the  thought  might  occur</span><span>  even  to  the  Nazi  intelligence  that  it  is  no  benefit  to  sell  to  a  country</span><span>  which  does  not  pay.  It  is  better  to  be  without  the  business.</span><span>  .  Ever  since  the  AVar  period,  German  national  finance  has  been</span><span>  a  stumbling  block  to  Europe.  After  the  inflation  period  the  Dawes</span><span>  loan  was  floated,  for  the  purpose  of  putting  Germany  upon  her</span><span>  financial  feet  and  restoring  her  currency.  When  the  final  reparation</span><span>  settlement  was  arrived  at,  the  Young  loan  was  floated  to  assist  in  that</span><span>  settlement.  Germany  had  the  money  but  reparations  have  been  done</span><span>  away  with.  At  every  turn  Germany  has  scored,  and  she  proposed</span><span>  to  crown  her  victories  of  the  past  by  an  open  repudiation  of  her</span><span>  international  obligations.  It  may  or  it  may  not  be  surprising  that</span><span>  Nazi  finance  should  in  the  end  come  down  to  the  same  level  as  the</span><span>  finance  of  the  Bolshevists,  to  whom  the  Nazi  spirit  is  alleged  to  be</span><span>  so  opposed.</span><span>  The  affair  may  prove  to  be  a  further  lesson,  and  it  may  be</span><span>  hoped  a  lesson  which  will  sink  home,  to  those  who  for  so  long  have</span><span>  argued  that  the  reconstruction  of  world  trade  can  only  be,  or  chiefly</span><span>  be,  accomplished  by  the  financial  reconstruction  of  Europe.  Hun</span><span>  dreds  of  millions  of  pounds  have  been  lent  to  the  countries  of  Central</span><span>  Europe  for  reconstruction  purposes,  with  the  consequence  that,  with</span><span>  one  exception  (Czechoslovakia),  they  are  all  to-day  as  bankrupt  as</span><span>  they  ever  were.</span></p> "

Considering  the  circumstances  of  government  in</span><span>  Germany  to-day,  there  could  never  have  been  much  doubt  upon</span><span>  this  point,  because  it  is  an  acknowledged  rule  of  Nazidom,  expressed</span><span>  many  times  by  Herren  Hitler,  Goering  and  Goebbels,  that  there</span><span>  can  be  no  opposition,  no  other  way  of  thinking  in  Germany  to</span><span>  that  which  these  gentlemen  dictate.</span><span>  The  result  of  the  plebiscite  was  in  the  affirmative,  and  it  has</span><span>  even  been  described  as  a  victorious  result.  Upon  examining  the</span><span>  figures,  however,  it  is  quite  clear  that  the  Nazi  Government  is  by  no</span><span>  means  as  popular  as  might  appear  from  the  figures.  About  10  per</span><span>  cent,  of  the  population  had  the  courage  to  vote  'No,'  whilst  almost</span><span>  as  many  again  either  spoilt  their  ballot  papers  or  did  not  vote  at</span><span>  all.  It  is  to  be  assumed  that  those  who  spoilt  their  papers  and  did</span><span>  not  vote  were  definitely  opposed  to  the  present  regime  but  had  not</span><span>  got  the  courage  to  say  so.</span><span>  After  all,  the  present  circumstances  of  Germany  are  particularly</span><span>  unhappy.  The  country  is  on  the  verge  of  bankruptcy;  the  restric</span><span>  tions  upon  food,  clothing  and  raw  materials  are  reminiscent  of  war</span><span>  time  measures:  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  is  deeply  dissatisfied,</span><span>  and  the  Protestant  Church  not  less  so  ;  the  great  Industrialists  view</span><span>  with  horror  the  swing  of  Nazi  economic  doctrine  towards  Com</span><span>  munism  ;  even  in  the  ranks  of  Hitlerdom  there  is  certainly  great</span><span>  unrest.  Foreign  observers  in  the  country  regard  the  situation</span><span>  internally  with  considerable  apprehension.</span><span>  The  events  of  June  30,  when  a  number  of  Storm  Troopers  were</span><span>  shot  out  of  hand,  when  General  von  Schleicher  and  his  wife  were</span><span>  assassinated,  and  an  unknown  number  of  persons  disposed  of,  have</span><span>  left  a  very  sour  impression  in  Germany  as  to  the  future.  The  re</span><span>  ception  accorded  to  the  Chancellor,  when  he  addressed  the  Reichstag</span><span>  a  fortnight  after  those  events,  was  cool  in  the  extreme.  The  per</span><span>  sonal  accounts  of  eye  witnesses  are  now  available  in  Australia,  and</span><span>  confirm  in  every  detail  and  strengthen  the  observations  which  were</span><span>  cabled  to  this  country  at  that  time.  The  position  has  been  summed</span><span>  up  as  representing  the  end  of  Nazism  as  it  has  been  in  the  past,  and</span><span>  the  beginning  of  its  end  altogether.</span><span>  The  internal  position  in  Germany  is  of  the  first  importance,  not</span><span>  only  to  Germany,  but  to  the  rest  of  the  world,  because,  whatever</span><span>  happens  in  that  country  must  seriously  affect  affairs  in  other  parts</span><span>  of  the  world,  particularly  the  present  stage  of  economic  recovery.</span><span>  This  has  been  seen  in  Australia  by  the  fall  in  the  wool  market,  fol</span><span>  lowing  upon  the  embargo  laid  by  Germany  upon  the  import  of  raw</span><span>  material.  It  is  the  continued  uncertainty  as  to  what  will  eventuate</span><span>  in  that  country  which  still  dominates  the  wool  market,  and  indeed,</span><span>  all  other  markets  for  raw  materials.</span><span>  It  is  not  until  Germany  becomes  stabilised  under  one  form  of</span><span>  Government  or  another,  and  until  what  Shakespeare  calls  'the</span><span>  alarums  and  excursions'  in  that  country  cease,  and  its  unhappy</span><span>  people  can  settle  down  to  internal  peace  and  internal  development,</span><span>  that  the  general  situation  can  right  itself.</span></p> "

Since  she</span><span>  has  no  friends  to  lose  she  has  thrown</span><span>  all  the  laws  of  warfare  overboard</span><span>  and  is  prepared  to  sink  the  ships  of</span><span>  any  nation  in  a  desperate  attempt</span><span>  to  blockade  Britain  as  she  herself  is</span><span>  blockaded.  It  is  a  campaign  of  ter</span><span>  rorism  that  will  serve  only  to  hasten</span><span>  the  alignment  of  nations  in  active</span><span>  opposition  to  Germany  in  this  war.</span><span>  Apart  from  the  way  in  which  the</span><span>  mines  are  being  used,  the  terrific</span><span>  explosive  content  of  some  of  them</span><span>  is  proof  of  Germany's  hope  of  in</span><span>  timidating  all  shipping  movement  in</span><span>  English  waters.  The  charges  are  far</span><span>  stronger  than  necessary  merely  to</span><span>  sink  a  ship.  The  vessels  that  strike</span><span>  them  are  blown  almost  to  pieces,</span><span>  making  heavy  loss  of  civilian  life  in</span><span>  evitable.</span><span>  The  sinking  of  the  Japanese  liner,</span><span>  Terekuni  Maru,  will  cause  great</span><span>  anger  and  perturbation  in  Japan,  and</span><span>  may  have  a  profound  effect  upon</span><span>  Japanese  foreign  policy  at  a  time</span><span>  when  Nippon's  international  rela</span><span>  tions  are  in  a  state  of  flux.  It  will</span><span>  be  useless  for  Germany  to  blame  Mr.</span><span>  Winston  Churchill  for  the  mining  of</span><span>  this  vessel.  Surprisingly  enough,  the</span><span>  Nazis  have  now  admitted  that  their</span><span>  mines  have  been  responsible  for  the</span><span>  loss  of  the  neutral  vessels  sunk  dur</span><span>  ing  the  last  few  days.  \"Germany  re</span><span>  grets  it  if  the  results  are  rather  sad</span><span>  for  neutrals,  but  can  do  nothing</span><span>  about  it,\"  said  a  broadcast  from</span><span>  Hamburg.  Perhaps  she  would  not</span><span>  have  been  so  frank  had  she  known</span><span>  that  within  a  few  hours  a  crack  Jap</span><span>  anese  liner  was  to  be  sent  to  the</span><span>  bottom  of  the  sea  by  her  agency.</span><span>  Japan  will  consider  this  disaster  in</span><span>  conjunction  with  the  report  that</span><span>  Germany  has  bought  from  Russia</span><span>  twenty  submarines  for  operations  in</span><span>  the  Far  East  and  the  Indian  Ocpan.</span><span>  The  risk  of  total  war  being  extended</span><span>  by  Germany  to  these  seas  cannot  be</span><span>  dismissed.  So  far  as  Britain  is  con</span><span>  cerned,  it  is  extremely  unlikely  that</span><span>  the  new  German  frightfulness  will  be</span><span>  successful  in  cutting  her  off  from  the</span><span>  world  and  starving  her  into  submis</span><span>  sion.  The  mine  menace  was  dealt</span><span>  with  in  the  last  war,  and  there  is</span><span>  no  reason  to  fear  that  this  success</span><span>  will  not  be  repeated.</span></p> "

Taking  the</span><span>  referendum.  the  question  was-\"Do</span><span>  \"you,  German  man,  and  you,  German</span><span>  \"woman,  approve  of  the  policy  of  your</span><span>  \"Government?

If  the  vote  is  a  true  reflex</span><span>  of  opinion,  the  world  is  told  that</span><span>  7.000,000  Social  Democrats  and</span><span>  4.000,000  Communists  who  were</span><span>  against  the  Nazis  last  March  have</span><span>  been.  converted  by  a  brutal  terrorism</span><span>  into  enthusiastic  admiration  for  the</span><span>  Nazi  regime.

It  must  be  clearly,  understood</span><span>  that  when  a  nation  secures  a  loan  from</span><span>  another  nation  no  money  is  inter</span><span>  changed.  Goods  or  materials  are  taken</span><span>  to  the  amount  of  the  credits  extended.</span><span>  :  Since  1918  credits  have  been  extend</span><span>  ed  to  Germany  through  the  control  re</span><span>  serve  franking  system  in  America  and</span><span>  England,  and  Germany  as  a  conse</span><span>  quence  has  become  so  completely  or</span><span>  ganised  in  air,  field  and  naval  arma</span><span>  ments  that  she  is  able  to  ignore  the</span><span>  League  of  Nations,  defy  the  world  and</span><span>  .hop  over  and  win  unopposed  conquests,</span><span>  and  the  prevaricating,  subtle,  under</span><span>  mining  diplomacy  stills  prevails  to  draw</span><span>  further  goods  and  materials  to  the</span><span>  strorighold.  Blatantly  denying</span><span>  the  responsibility  for  the  last  war,  she</span><span>  may  yet  blame  Britain  for  the  next  be</span><span>  cause  the  world  is  not  willing  to  hand</span><span>  over  mandated  territories  upon  demand.</span><span>  It  must  be  clearly  ,  understood  that  the</span><span>  world  is  not  dealing  with  German</span><span>  people,  who  are  a  very  fine  race.  A</span><span>  gang  of  fiends  who  are  organising  world</span><span>  wide  mass  murder,  hide  behind  all  this</span><span>  vast  camouflage  and  the  German  people</span><span>  are  .  hungry  because  their  resources,</span><span>  energy  and  hundreds  of  millions  Of</span><span>  pounds  of  their  wealth  are  absorbed</span><span>  annually  in  the  maintenance  and  fur</span><span>  ther  development  of  the  mighty  war</span><span>  organisation.</span><span>  The  bluff  about  being  unable  to  pay</span><span>  has  continued  all  too  long.  The  people</span><span>  of  the  world  in  general,  and  Great  Bri</span><span>  tain  in  particular,  should  rub  their</span><span>  sleepy  eyes  and  realise  what  is  hap</span><span>  pening  by  the  international  money  sys</span><span>  tem  controlling  and  extending  credits.</span><span>  When  Great  Britain  needs  armaments</span><span>  for  defence,  made  necessary  by  such</span><span>  gigantic  and,  advanced  preparations  in</span><span>  Germany,  she  is  told  by  the  same  inter</span><span>  national  money  monopoly  that  she  must</span><span>  provide  her  defences  from  taxation.</span><span>  It  is  to  be  regretted  that  there  is  an</span><span>  absence  of  such  writers  on  national  and</span><span>  international  affairs.</span><span>  In  substantiation  of  Mr.  Ager's  con</span><span>  tribution,  I  quote  a  broadcast  speeclFby</span><span>  Dr.  Goddard  on  Sunday  night,  February</span><span>  14,  on  international  affairs  from  2BL</span><span>  recorded  in  \"The  Book  of  Time.\"  Per</span><span>  chance  many  listeners  are  aware  that</span><span>  Dr.  Goddard  is  an  authority  on  inter</span><span>  national  affairs.  He  said:  Germany  in</span><span>  her  race  for  armaments  is  depriving</span><span>  every  individual  population  of  £160  of</span><span>  food  yearly.</span><span>  -From  time  to  time  the  cables  flash</span><span>  across  the  world  some  startling  arith</span><span>  metic,  but  unfortunately  the  country</span><span>  press  only  receives  a  brevis  .  account  -in</span><span>  a  condensed  or  mutilated  'form.  Since</span></p> <p><span>  1914  to  1927  it  has  been  my  hobby  to</span><span>  devote  my  leisure  to  national  and  in</span><span>  ternational  affairs  published  monthly  in</span><span>  the  magazine  \"Life.\"</span><span>  Some  newspaper  writers,  -of  course,</span><span>  if  only  by  force,  of  habit,  reflect  and</span><span>  exaggerate  the  mood  ;  of  the  moment,</span><span>  and  they  change  with  the  mood.  They</span><span>  are  not  so  closely  in  touch  with  actual</span><span>  facts.</span><span>  .DISTRACTED  GERMANY.</span><span>  Germany,  to  the  hasty  observer,  might</span><span>  well  seem  to  be  on  the  point  of  bank</span><span>  ruptcy.  In  1923  Sir  Phillip  Gibbs,  thei</span><span>  noted  war  correspondent,  visited  .  Ger-  1</span><span>  many,  and  gave  a  graphic  story  of  what:</span><span>  he  saw  there.  He  said,  however,  that</span><span>  with  the  mark  at  5uo,000,000  to  the  Eng</span><span>  lish  pound  note  there  was  still  no  out</span><span>  ward  sign  of  poverty  or  rum  in  Ger</span><span>  many.\"  He  could  not  make  head  or</span><span>  cail  of  this  wild  melodrama  of  paper</span><span>  money  which,  fell  .In  value  by  tens:,  of</span><span>  millions  between  the  \"soup  and  the</span><span>  xoffee  of  his  midday  meal.  It  seemed</span><span>  to  make  \"no  difference  \"  tOtKe  people.</span><span>  They  still  thronged  the  restaurants  and</span><span>  cabarets  and  though  .prices  rose.  auto</span><span>  matically  as  the  exchange  falls,  thev</span><span>  .eemed  to  get  enough  of  this  f\\ntastic</span><span>  currency  to  pay  f  0  c.  their  pleasure  as</span><span>  well  as  their  necessity.  \"But,\"  he</span><span>  added,  \"this  is  the  way  in  which  mod</span><span>  ern  civilisation  '  masks  for  a  time  the</span><span>  decay  and  the  disease  which  are  eating</span><span>  at  its  vitals  like  a  spreading  cancer.\"</span><span>  Even  to  the  cool  Australian  mind</span><span>  looking  across  the  sea  at  the  distrac</span><span>  tions  and  tumult  of  what  we  call  \"Ger</span><span>  many,\"  it  seems  .that.it  offers  a  spec</span><span>  tacle  of  ruin  such  as  Europe  has  not</span><span>  seen  since  the  Forty  Years'  \"Vvar.  Yet</span><span>  the  ruin  is  not  brought  on  Germany  by</span></p> <p><span>  the  sword  of  its  enemies,  but  by  the</span><span>  insane  policy  of  its  own  rulers.  They</span><span>  were  too  proud  to  accept  defeat,  and</span><span>  have  tried  to  evade;  its  just  conse</span><span>  quences.  The  German  currency  has</span><span>  been  deliberately  ruined—  and  ruined</span><span>  on  a  scale  unknown;.in  history—  as  part</span><span>  of  the  plan  to  make  the  payment  of</span><span>  the  reparations  for  the  wrongs  done  to</span><span>  the  nations  it  attacked.  We  have  but</span><span>  to  contrast  how  Germany  treated</span><span>  France  in  1870.  For  six  months'  war</span><span>  she  exacted  a  fine  of  £200,000,000  —  and</span><span>  Alsace-Lorraine!  And  her  troops  were</span><span>  quartered  on  France  -till  this  penalty</span><span>  was  paid.  .Or  we  have  but  to  contrast</span><span>  the  policy  since  defeat  adopted  by</span><span>  Austria  with  that  of  Germany  to  realise</span><span>  that  Germany  has.  brought'  upon  itself</span><span>  the  suffering  which  now  almost  theatens</span><span>  it  with  destruction.  Austria  accepted</span><span>  its  defeat,  and  has  honestly  paid,  as  far</span><span>  as  possible  the  price  of  defeat!  As  a</span><span>  result,  it  has  the  sympathy  and  help  of</span><span>  Europe,  and  is  back  towards  prosper</span><span>  ity.  It  is  cruel,  perhaps,  to  say  that  '</span><span>  Germany  has  tried  to  cheat  its  creditors,</span><span>  but  has  it  honestly  tried'  to  pay  them?</span><span>  THE  DANCE  OF  THE  GERMAN</span><span>  MARK.</span><span>  Only  a  mathematician  accustomed  to</span><span>  deal  with  what-  may  be  called  astrono</span><span>  mical  magnitudes  can  keep  touch  with</span><span>  the  performances  of  the  German  mark;</span><span>  but  a  record  of  its  gyrations  during,</span><span>  say,  a  single  fortnight,  may  be  attempt</span><span>  ed.  The  week  before  the  issue  of  the</span><span>  Baldwin-Curzon  note,  the  German  mark</span><span>  was  rated  at  4,000,000  to  the  dollar,  a'rid</span><span>  under  the  influence  of  the  British  letter</span></p> <p><span>  it  went  up  a  few  points  and  reached</span><span>  2.500,000  to  the  dollar.  Then  came  the</span><span>  blast  of  Poincai-e's  reply,  with  its  twin</span><span>  document  from  Brussels,  and  the  mark</span><span>  tumbled  down  with  meteoric  speed  till</span><span>  it  touched  about  7,000,000;:  and  then</span><span>  8,000,000  to  the  dollar.  On.:  September</span><span>  5,  1923,  it  had  gone  almost  completely</span><span>  out  of  sight,  as  it  descended  to</span><span>  20,000,000  to  the  dollar,  and  continued</span><span>  its  downward  flight  till  it  actually</span><span>  reached  44,000,000  to  the  dollar.</span><span>  The  mark,  it  must  be  remembered,</span><span>  .before  the  Great  War,  was  equal  in</span><span>  I  value  to  the  British  shilling;  at  the</span><span>  point  reached  it  was  equal  to  a  forty-</span><span>  millionth  part  of  a  dollar,  a  value  which</span><span>  only  a  microscope  of  the  highest  magni</span><span>  fying  power  could  do  so  much  as  see.</span><span>  It  was  expected  then  to  fall  tc</span><span>  100,  LOU,  000  to  the  dollar\",  which</span><span>  is  about  zero,  and  at  that  stage  \"not</span><span>  only  cities,  towns  and  Villages,  but</span><span>  State  railways,  banks,  manufacturing</span><span>  co-operations,  business  houses  and  even  .</span><span>  individuals  have  been  printing  and</span><span>  issuing  their  own  flat  money  during  tnc  I</span><span>  shortage.\"  Now,  how  can  civilised</span><span>  existence  continue  under  such  con</span><span>  ditions?  And  since  then  the  mark  has</span><span>  fallen  to  yet  lower  depths!—  I  am,  etc.,</span></p> <p><span>  PETER  KNIGHT.  -</span></p> "

No  doubt  a  great  part  of</span><span>  the  muddle  was  due  to  the  insistence</span><span>  of  President  Wilson  that  the  adjust-</span><span>  ment  of  conditions  must  be  delayed</span><span>  until  his  own  special,  fad  was  dealt</span><span>  with.  Certainly  that  insistence  was</span><span>  responsible  for  the  hasty  creation  of</span><span>  the  League  of  Nations,  but  since</span><span>  America  at  once  repudiated  the  under-</span><span>  takings  of  her  President,  nothing  was</span><span>  gained.  The  history  of  the  world</span><span>  since  has  been  a  sad  one.  Some  of  the</span><span>  clauses  of  the  Treaty  of  Versailles</span><span>  have  been  ignored,  and  the  financial</span><span>  clauses  of  this  and  other  treaties  have</span><span>  been  changed,  and  changed  again,  un-</span><span>  til  they  are  unrecognisable.  And  now</span><span>  Germany  is  in  a  condition  of  practical</span><span>  revolt  against  the  conditions  of  the</span><span>  Treaty  limiting  her  right  to  arma-</span><span>  ments.  For  this  spirit,  we  arc  sorry</span><span>  to  say,  France  has  some  responsibility.</span><span>  In  spite  of  the  fact  that  Germany  has</span><span>  been  left  practically  helpless  for  ag-</span><span>  gression,  France  refuses  every  sugges-</span><span>  tion  for  a  substantial  reduction  of</span><span>  armaments.  Perhaps  this  consistent</span><span>  refusal,  and  the  examples  of  chauvin-</span><span>  ism,  are  more  directed  against  Italy,</span><span>  but,  in  order  to  avoid  complications,</span><span>  Germany  is  held  up  as  the  potential</span><span>  enemy.  There  has  been  much  adverse</span><span>  comment  as  to  the  failure  of  Great</span><span>  Britain,  through  the  League  of  Na-</span><span>  tions,  or  otherwise,  to  bring  about  a</span><span>  settlement.  This  criticism  is  not  just.</span><span>  Great  Britain  has,  during  and  since</span><span>  the  War,  pulled  so  many  chestnuts  out</span><span>  of  the  fire  for  others,  all  of  whom  were</span><span>  ungrateful,  thal  suggestions  of  further</span><span>  burning  of  fingers  in  the  cause  of  al-</span><span>  truism  are  not  welcomed.  If  France</span><span>  really  reduced  armaments,  probably</span><span>  Germany  would  not  make  any  demand</span><span>  for  equality.</span></p> "

He  said,</span><span>  for  instance,  that  the  Kaiser  aban</span></p> <p><span>  doned  the  policy  of  Bismark,  which</span><span>  stood  for  European  concentration,</span><span>  friendly  alliance,  and  prevention  by</span><span>  diplomacy  of  alliances  between  other</span><span>  countries.  On  the  contrary,  ihe  Bis</span><span>  markian  policy  was  one  of  deliberate</span><span>  and  ruthless  conquest.  His  famous  de</span><span>  claration  was  that  the  destinies  of</span><span>  Germany  were  to  be  worked  out  not</span><span>  by  notes  and  speeches,  but  by  blood</span><span>  and  iron.  His  three  successful  wars  in</span><span>  six  years  earned  for  him  the  name</span><span>  of  'The  Iron  Chancellor.'</span><span>  Mr.  Jones  says  that  during  the</span><span>  Spanish-American  war,  the  Kaiser  ap</span><span>  proached  England  with  regard  to  op</span><span>  posing  the  United  States,  and  that</span><span>  England  stood  by  America.  But  Mr.</span><span>  Usher,  in  his  book,  asserts  that  the</span><span>  Spanish-American  war  was  instigated</span><span>  by  England  in  order  to  prevent  Ger</span><span>  many  from  acquiring  the  Spanish</span><span>  colonies.  Both  statements  may  be</span><span>  wrong.</span><span>  Again,  Mr.  Jones  says  that  during</span><span>  the  Boer  War,  Germany  made  over</span><span>  tures  to  France  and  Russia,  suggest</span><span>  ing  combined  action  against  England,</span><span>  but  that  they  refused.  According  lo</span><span>  historians  Russia  and  France  were  pre</span><span>  pared  to  intervene  on  behalf  of  the</span><span>  Boer  Republic  if  Germany  would  join,</span><span>  but  she  refused  to  do  so.  In  1899</span><span>  the  London  'Daily  Mail'  was  full  of</span><span>  praise  of  Germany.  The  Kaiser  was</span><span>  hailed  as  'a  '  friend  in  need,  and  a</span><span>  gallant  gentleman  whose  word  is  bet</span><span>  ter  than  many  another's  bond.1',</span><span>  Mr.  Jones  refers  to  General  Bern</span><span>  hardi's  book  as  proof  of  Germany's</span><span>  guilt,  A  book,  exactly  parallel  to</span><span>  General  Bernhardi's,  entitled  'L'Of-</span></p> <p><span>  fensive  Contre  Allemagne'  has  been</span><span>  written  in  France  by  Colonel  Boucher.</span><span>  Another  correspondent,  Mr.  Watson,</span><span>  mentioned  the  Agadir  incident,  m  1911</span><span>  French  and  Spanish  troops  had  all</span><span>  leir  spheres  marked  out  for  them  by  '</span><span>  the  secret  articles  in  the  Anglo-French</span><span>  agreement.  France  took  the  lead  in</span><span>  threatening  war.  Germany  sent  'The</span><span>  Panther'  to  Agadir  as  a  protest.

We  think  that  text-books</span><span>  for  beginners  should  make  the  student  acquainted</span><span>  with  the  living  rather  than  the  dead  language  by</span><span>  interesting  him  in  stories  of  contemporary  life.

And  it  Is  almost  in</span><span>  credible  how  marvellously  they</span><span>  succeeded  in  nearly  every  cultural</span><span>  province.</span></p> <p><span>  At  first  thought  it  may  seem</span><span>  not  worth  the  while  to  remember</span><span>  what  the  Jews  have  achieved  in</span><span>  Germany  and  for  Germany.  In</span><span>  deed  the  wheels  of  history  will  not</span><span>  be  turned  into  any  other  direction</span><span>  by  the  statement  how  much  the</span><span>  Jews  have  added  to  the  benefit</span><span>  of  German  name  and  German</span><span>  fame.  But  it  will  buttress  the</span><span>  proud  and  the  certain  feeling  of</span><span>  the  Jews  themselves  that  one  day</span><span>  when  the  waves  of  hatred  will</span><span>  have  been  .  calmed  down  Jewish</span><span>  accomplishments  will  be  recognis</span><span>  ed  again  and  that  the  world  will</span><span>  give  the  Jews  that  place,  in  the</span><span>  council  of  peoples  for  which  they</span></p> <p><span>  .  are  entitled  to  claim.</span></p> <p><span>  When  the  Jews  in  the  beginning</span><span>  of  the  19th  century  were—ac</span><span>  least  formally—admitted  as  equal</span><span>  to  the  community  of  free  men  in</span><span>  Germany,  it  was  as  if  a  bulwark</span><span>  had  been  broken  down  and  the</span><span>  water  dammed  up  behind  it  had</span><span>  fallen  like  a  torrent  into  the  open</span><span>  land.  So  powerful  was  the  mental</span><span>  energy  that  became  free  and  ru</span><span>  shed  down  into  every  district  of</span><span>  spiritual  activity.  Impossible  to</span><span>  count  down  every  Jew  who  has</span><span>  added  stones  to  the  edifice  of  Ger</span><span>  man  art  and  science.  We  can  give</span><span>  only  a  few  names  out  of  thou</span><span>  sands.  But  we  can  appraise  the</span><span>  real  significance  of  that  powerful,</span><span>  stream  of  spii’itual  fructification</span><span>  only  if  we  consider  that  the  Jews</span><span>  comprising  but  1  per  cent  of  the</span><span>  German  population  at  once  took</span><span>  part  in  the  building  up  of  the  cul</span><span>  tural  life  by  contributors  out</span><span>  numbering  10  or  even  20  times</span><span>  their  actual  proportion  of  the  po</span><span>  pulation.  An  example  may  make</span><span>  it  clear  how  this  miraculous  fact</span><span>  turned  out  to  be  of  almost  in</span><span>  credible  .  effects:  The  Jews  for  in</span><span>  stance  brought  forth  9  remarkable</span><span>  composers  in  a  little  more  than</span><span>  one  century;  the  Germans,  in  or</span><span>  der  to  keep  pace  should  have  had</span><span>  to  muster  900  (!)  equivalent  ta</span><span>  lents  or  take  another  example:</span><span>  About  25  per  cent  of  the  German</span><span>  Nobel-prize  winners  were  Jews,</span><span>  equal  to  five  .times  more  than</span><span>  their  proportion.  And  so  it/-  was</span><span>  in  nearly  every  district  of  cultural</span></p> <p><span>  life.</span></p> <p><span>  At  the  beginning  of  that  “Pe-  ,</span><span>  riod  of  Enlightenment”,  stands  the</span><span>  venerable  figure  of  the  poor  hunch</span><span>  backed  office  clerk  and  great</span><span>  philosopher  Moses  Mendelssohn,</span><span>  the  friend  of  Lessing.  He  was  still</span><span>  deep-rooted  in  Jewish  feelings  and</span><span>  it  was  but  in  his  adult  years  that</span></p> <p><span>  he  learnt  to  write  German.  Pro</span><span>  found  was  his  influence  on  Ger</span><span>  man  philosophy.  (The  fate  of  his</span><span>  children  is  significant;  it  shows</span><span>  how  quickly  by  the  way  of  assi</span><span>  milation  large  and  valuable  parts</span><span>  of  Jewry  have  been  absorbed  by</span><span>  the  German  people:  Two  of  his</span><span>  sons,  baptized,  became  the  found</span><span>  ers’  of  one  of  most  famous  Euro</span><span>  pean  Banks.  His  daughter,  also</span><span>  baptised,  was  renowned  for  her</span><span>  literary  salon  and  played  an  im</span><span>  portant  part  in  the  history  of  Ger</span><span>  man  literature.  His  grandson  Felix</span><span>  Mendelssohn-Bartholdy,  baptised,</span><span>  was  one  of  the  greatest  German</span><span>  composers.  And  many  of  his  des</span><span>  cendents  are  reputed  as  artists</span><span>  and  scientists).  Besides  Mendel</span><span>  ssohn  there  were  many  more  Jew</span><span>  ish  philosophers  as  for  instance</span><span>  Salomon  Maimon,  Otto  Liebmann,</span><span>  Herman  Cohen,  Gustav  ^  Simmel,</span><span>  Gustav  Landauer  etc.  Although,</span><span>  they  were  not  the  great  lonely</span><span>  stars  they  influenced  largely</span><span>  thoughts  and  ideas  in  Germany.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  discipline  of  Physics,</span><span>  Mathematics  and  Physics  near  to</span><span>  the  province  of  Philosophy,  scores</span><span>  of  Jews  excelled.  The  one  Einstein</span><span>  would  suffice  to  procure  the  Jews</span><span>  a  place  of  honour  in  the  history</span><span>  of  Science.  Only  the  coming  cen</span><span>  turies  can  judge  fully  his  import</span><span>  ance.  But  he  seems  to  be  a  genius</span><span>  the  like  of  whom  mankind  pro</span><span>  duces  only  every  some  centuries  to</span><span>  be  placed  in  line  with  men  like</span><span>  Ptolemy,  Galileo,  Giordano  Bruno</span><span>  and  Newton.  And  there  are  many</span><span>  others  whose  names  can  keep  the</span><span>  field  also  besides  Einstein.  Hertz</span><span>  (theory  .  of  electric  waves),  J.</span><span>  Frank  (theory  of  atoms),  David</span><span>  sohn  (electro  motor),  Marcus</span><span>  (petrol  motor),  Berliner  (micro</span><span>  phone),  Haber  (nitrogen),  Frank</span><span>  (Kali),  Caro  (dyes),  Willstaetter</span><span>  (Chlorophyl),  Bayer,  the  son  of  a</span><span>  Jewish  mother  and  the  founder  of</span><span>  the'  mighty  German  Dye  concern</span><span>  (indigo)  and  practically  thou</span><span>  sands  of  famous  names  more.</span></p> <p><span>  Jews  have  always  been  prepon</span><span>  derant  physicians  and  that  may</span><span>  partly  explain  the  fact  that  there</span><span>  was  nearly  no  inventive  medical</span><span>  achievement  without  Jewish  guid</span></p> <p><span>  ance  or  at  least  Jewish  assistance.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  almost  impossible  an  under</span><span>  taking  to  enumerate  the  names  of</span><span>  the  countless  medical  pioneers  and</span><span>  only  a  few  ones  may  therefore  be</span><span>  mentioned  who  acquired  wide  pub</span><span>  lic  fame.  So  Meyerhof  (transfor</span></p> <p><span>  mation  of  energy),  Zunz  (physio</span><span>  logy),  Ehrlich  (Salvarsan),  Was</span><span>  sermann  and  Morgenroth  (both</span><span>  diagnosis  of  syphilis,  Freud</span><span>  (psychoanalysis),  Adler  (indivi</span><span>  dual  psychology),  Minkowsky</span><span>  (diabetes),  Boas  (stomach  di</span><span>  seases),  Zondeck  (internal  di</span><span>  seases),  Asehheim  (pregnancy</span><span>  diagnosis)  etc.</span></p> <p><span>  ,  But  how  much  soever  all  these</span><span>  contributions  have  added  to  the</span><span>  famous  reputation  of  German  cul</span><span>  ture  the  public  in  general  knew</span><span>  and  appreciated  better  the  Jews,</span><span>  who  worked  in  the  sphere  of  the</span><span>  arts.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  first  line  it  was  the  Jew</span><span>  ish  musicians  who,  even  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  land  of  music  proper”  attracted</span></p> <p><span>  the  eyes  or  rather  the  ears  of</span><span>  their  contemporaries.  There  •  are</span><span>  the  composers  Mendelssohn,  Mey</span><span>  ei’beer,  Offenbach,  Moscheles,  Ru</span><span>  binstein,  Joachim,  Mahler,  Schoen</span><span>  berg,  Korngold,  there  are  the  con</span><span>  ducted  Walter,  Klemperer,  Klei</span><span>  ber,  there  are  the  countless  prac</span><span>  titioning  musicians'  of  world-wide</span><span>  fame  like  Schnabel,  Horowitz,  Ser</span><span>  kin,  Hubermann,  Kreisler,  Morini,</span><span>  Tauber  and  scores  of  them  more.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  art  of  painting  it  was</span><span>  Liebermann,  Israels,  Lesser  Ury,</span><span>  Chagall,  Feinger,  Marees  (a  half</span><span>  Jew)  etc.  who  helped  to  develop</span><span>  German  artistic  reputation.  That</span><span>  seems  to  be  indeed  a  very  surpris</span><span>  ing  fact.  For  since  the  Jews,  pre</span></p> <p><span>  (Continued  on  page  6)</span></p> <p><span>  GERMAN  JEWS  AND  GERMAN  CULTURE</span></p> <p><span>  (Continued  from  page  4)</span></p> <p><span>  vented  by  religious  prohibitions,</span><span>  had  never  excelled  in  the  field  of</span><span>  painting  it  was  all  the  more  mir</span><span>  aculous  that  they  could  hold  their</span><span>  own  without  any  existing  artistic</span></p> <p><span>  tradition.</span></p> <p><span>  Always  have  the  Jews  been  bear</span><span>  ers  of  a  deep  inner  conscience  and</span><span>  masters  of  the  word.  Since  the</span><span>  days  of  the  Prophets  they  have</span><span>  been  the  proclaimed  and  propa</span><span>  gators  of  teachings,  doctrines  and</span><span>  convictions.  That  may  be  the  ex</span><span>  planation  of  the  immense  part</span><span>  played  by  Jews  in  the  German</span><span>  literature.  The  way  leading  from</span><span>  Heinrich  Heine  to  Stephan  Zweig</span><span>  is  short  in  time  but  overcrowded</span><span>  by  writing,  composing,  teaching</span><span>  and  admonishing  Jews:  Boeme</span><span>  and  Weininger,  Wassermann  and</span><span>  Werfel,  Kaffka  and  Heimann,</span><span>  Schnitzler  and  Hofmannsthal,  Bu</span><span>  ber  and  Mombert,  Toller  and</span><span>  Weissi,  Brod  and  Arnold  Zweig,</span><span>  Doeblin  and  Beer-Hoffmann  are</span><span>  only  a  few  names  casually  picked</span><span>  out  of  the  innumerable  spiritual</span><span>  Jews  who  have  influenced  the</span><span>  thoughts  and  feelings  of  the  Ger</span><span>  man  people.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  practically  impossible  even</span><span>  if  the  limited  space  would  not</span><span>  prohibit  it—to  mention  every  do</span></p> <p><span>  main  where  the  Jews  had  a  share</span><span>  in  the  shaping  of  German  culture.</span><span>  Industry  and  economicsi,  sociology</span><span>  and  agriculture,  film  and  theatre</span><span>  dance  and  architecture,  journal</span><span>  istics  and  playwriting,  charity  and</span></p> <p><span>  art-donations  were  but  a  few  ones</span><span>  of  the  vast  provinces  of  Jewish</span></p> <p><span>  collaboration.</span></p> <p><span>  How  is  it  possible  that  in  spite</span><span>  of  all  this  cultural  work  done  by</span><span>  Jews  the  terrible  outbursts  of</span><span>  cruelty  against  the  German  Jews</span><span>  could  happen  ?  Probably  because</span><span>  the  people  did  not  know  how  great</span></p> <p><span>  the  share  of  the  Jews-  in  all  those</span><span>  cultural  achievements  had  been.</span></p> <p><span>  For  however  magnificent  the</span><span>  Jewish  accomplishments  were</span><span>  they  did  not  reach  the  bulk  of  the</span><span>  people.  The  ideas  of  the  Jewish</span><span>  writers'  were  too  elaborate,  too</span><span>  high-brow,  to  be  understood  by</span><span>  the  masses.  They  became  the  spi</span><span>  ritual  food  of  the  intelligentsia</span><span>  with  the  exception  of  Heine  whose</span></p> <p><span>  poems  are  recited  and  sung  by  the</span><span>  whole  of  Germany,  .  but  .  mostly</span><span>  without  any  knowledge  who  wrote</span><span>  those  deeply  touching  songs.  And</span><span>  again  the  composers  although</span><span>  some  of  thefn  being  pacemakers  of</span><span>  new  musical  ways  did  not  pene</span><span>  trate  into  the  people’s  hearts,  be</span><span>  side  Mendelssohn  whose  songs</span><span>  went  straight  to  the  people’s  feel</span><span>  ings.  And  even  men  who  achieved</span><span>  the  most  practical  successes  like</span><span>  Haber  who  saved  Germany  from</span><span>  losing  the  world  war  in  its  first</span><span>  year,  or  Ehrlich  who  released  the</span><span>  world  from  one  of  its  deadliest</span><span>  plagues,  were  not  popular  because</span><span>  the  simple-minded  maxi,  could  not</span><span>  conceive  their  complicated  con</span><span>  structive  work.</span></p> <p><span>  Shall  we  wonder  about  it?  No,</span><span>  for  not  even  the  Jewish  ^masses</span><span>  knew  it.  Even  now  after  the  last</span><span>  years  of  Jewish  persecution  and</span><span>  reawakening  of  Jewish  conscious</span><span>  ness  a  French  Jew  with  whom  I</span><span>  conversed  recently  had  no  idea</span><span>  that  Bergson  and  Andre  Maurois</span></p> <p><span>  were  Jews  and  Anatole  France</span><span>  half  of  Jewish  parentage.</span></p> <p><span>  Must  we  therefore  assume  that</span><span>  all  the  cultural  work  done  by</span><span>  Jews  has  been  in  vain?  Certainly</span><span>  not.  Material  values  can  be  lost,</span><span>  money,  houses,  diamonds  can  be</span><span>  destroyed  but  spiritual  values  that</span><span>  have  been  produced  remain..  Books</span><span>  which  have  been  printed  can  be</span><span>  burnt  but  their  contents  cannot  be</span><span>  burned.  Heads  can  be  cut  off.but</span><span>  thoughts  which  they  had  spoken</span><span>  out,  the  songs  which  have  been</span><span>  sung,  cannot  been  drowned,  smoth</span><span>  ered,  hanged.  The  cultural  achive</span><span>  ments  the  Jews  have  produced  in</span><span>  Germany  will  be  remain  alive  and</span><span>  there  will  be  again  a  time  of</span><span>  peace  when  all  that  Einstein  and</span><span>  Freud,  Mendelssohn  and  Heine</span><span>  have  thought,  said,  written  and</span><span>  sung,  will  again  be  heard,  read</span><span>  and  sung,  and  when  again  will  be</span><span>  thought  of  with  deep  and  kind</span><span>  feelings  of  thankfulness  those  men</span><span>  who  have  served  the  progress  of</span><span>  man  with  the  best  of  their  lives.</span></p> <p><span>  But  something  more  will  come</span><span>  out  again  of  the  marvellous  riches</span><span>  of  Jewish  spirit.  Those  riches</span><span>  which  have  survived  the  centuries</span></p> <p><span>  of  prosecution  will  remain  in  the</span><span>  same  way  alive  in  spite  df  the  new</span><span>  pains  that  have  come  down  over</span><span>  Jewry.  The  men  who  have  pro</span><span>  duced  all  those  miracles  of  their</span><span>  spirits  have  had  to  go  again  on</span><span>  their  new  travels  throughout  the</span><span>  world.  They  had  to  leave  behind</span><span>  them  their  fortunes,  their  money,</span><span>  even  their  clothes.  But  they  have</span><span>  taken  along  with  thentselves  their</span><span>  unbroken  spirit.  That  spirit  wher</span><span>  ever  the  Jews  will  be  driven  out</span></p> <p><span>  and  wherever  they  ‘  will  settle</span><span>  afresh  will  fructify  again  mankind</span><span>  for  the  benefit  of  the  human  race</span><span>  and  to  the  honour  of  the  Jewish</span></p> <p><span>  name.</span></p> "

Since  the</span><span>  days  of  the  Prophets  they  have</span><span>  been  the  proclaimed  and  propa</span><span>  gators  of  teachings,  doctrines  and</span><span>  convictions.  That  may  be  the  ex</span><span>  planation  of  the  immense  part</span><span>  played  by  Jews  in  the  German</span><span>  literature.  The  way  leading  from</span><span>  Heinrich  Heine  to  Stephan  Zweig</span><span>  is  short  in  time  but  overcrowded</span><span>  by  writing,  composing,  teaching</span><span>  and  admonishing  Jews:  Boerne</span><span>  and  Weininger,  Wassermann  and</span><span>  Werfel,  Kaffka  and  Heimann,</span><span>  Schnitzler  and  Hofmannsthal,  Bu</span><span>  ber  and  Mombert,  Toller  and</span><span>  Weiss,  Brod  and  Arnold  Zweig,</span><span>  Doeblin  and  Beer-Hoffmann  are</span></p> <p><span>  only  a  few  names  casually  picked</span><span>  out  of  the  innumerable  spiritual</span><span>  Jews  who  have  influenced  the</span></p> <p><span>  thoughts  and  feelings  of  the  Ger</span><span>  man  people.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  practically  impossible  even</span><span>  if  the  limited  space  would  not</span><span>  prohibit  it—to  mention  every  do</span><span>  main  where  the  Jews  had  a  share</span><span>  in  the  shaping  of  German  culture.</span><span>  Industry  and  economics:,  sociology</span><span>  and  agriculture,  film  and  theatre</span><span>  dance  and  architecture,  journal</span><span>  istics  and  playwriting,  charity  and</span><span>  art-donations  were  but  a  few  ones</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  vast  provinces  of  Jewish</span></p> <p><span>  collaboration.</span></p> <p><span>  How  is  it  possible  that  in  spite</span><span>  of  all  this  cultural  work  done  by</span><span>  Jews  the  terrible  outbursts  of</span><span>  cruelty  against  the  German  Jews</span><span>  could  happen  ?  Probably  because</span><span>  the  people  did  not  know  how  great</span><span>  the  share  of  the  Jews  in  all  those</span><span>  cultural  achievements  had  been.</span></p> <p><span>  For  however  magnificent  the</span><span>  Jewish  accomplishments  were</span><span>  they  did  not  reach  the  bulk  of  the</span><span>  people.  The  ideas  of  the  Jewish</span><span>  writers'  were  too  elaborate,  too</span><span>  high-brow,  to  be  understood  by</span><span>  the  masses.  They  became  the  spi</span><span>  ritual  food  of  the  intelligentsia,</span><span>  with  the  exception  of  Heine  whose</span><span>  poems  are  recited,  and  sung  by  the</span><span>  whole  of  Germany,  but  mostly</span><span>  without  any  knowledge  who  wrote</span><span>  those  deeply  touching  songs.  And</span><span>  again  the  composers  although</span><span>  some  of  them  being  pacemakers  of</span><span>  new  musical  ways  did  not  pene</span><span>  trate  into  the  people’s  hearts,  be</span></p> <p><span>  side  Mendelssohn  whose  songs</span><span>  went  straight  to  the  people’s  feel</span><span>  ings.  And  even  men  who  achieved</span><span>  the  most  practical  successes  like</span><span>  Haber  who  saved  Germany  from</span></p> <p><span>  losing  the  world  war  in  its  first  I</span><span>  year,  or  Ehrlich  who  released  the</span><span>  world  from  one  of  its  deadliest</span><span>  plagues,  were  not  popular  because</span><span>  the  simple-minded  man  could  not</span><span>  conceive  their  complicated  con</span></p> <p><span>  structive  work.</span></p> <p><span>  Shall  we  wonder  about  it?  No,</span><span>  for  not  even  the  Jewish  masses</span><span>  knew  it.  Even  now  after  the  last</span><span>  years  of  Jewish  persecution  and</span><span>  reawakening  of  Jewish  conscious</span><span>  ness  a  French  Jew  with  whom  I</span><span>  conversed  recently  had  no  idea</span><span>  that  Bergson  and  Andre  Maurois</span><span>  were  Jews  and  Anatole  France</span><span>  half  of  Jewish  parentage.</span></p> <p><span>  Must  we  therefore  assume  that</span><span>  all  the  cultural  work  done  by</span><span>  Jews  has  been  in  vain?  Certainly</span><span>  not.  Material  values  can  be  lost,</span><span>  money,  houses,  diamonds  can  .be</span><span>  destroyed  but  spiritual  values  that</span><span>  have  been  produced  remain.  Books</span><span>  which  have  been  printed  can  be</span><span>  burnt  but  their  contents  cannot  be</span></p> <p><span>  |  burned.  Heads  can  be  cut  off  but</span></p> <p><span>  thoughts  which  they  had  spoken</span><span>  out,  the  songs  which  have  been</span><span>  sung,  cannot  been  drowned,  smoth</span><span>  ered,  hanged.  The  cultural  achive</span><span>  ments  the  Jews  have  produced  in.</span><span>  Germany  will  be  remain  alive  and</span><span>  there  will  be  again  a  time  of</span><span>  peace  when  all  that  Einstein  and</span><span>  Freud,  Mendelssohn  and  Heine</span><span>  have  thought,  said,  written  and</span><span>  sung,  will  again  be  heard,  read</span><span>  and  sung,  and  when  again  will  be</span><span>  thought  of  with  deep  and  kind</span><span>  feelings  of  thankfulness  those  men</span><span>  who  have  served  the  progress  of</span><span>  man  with  the  best  of  their  lives.</span></p> <p><span>  But  something  more  will  come</span><span>  out  again  of  the  marvellous  riches</span><span>  of  Jewish  spirit.  Those  riches</span><span>  which  have  survived  the  centuries</span><span>  of  prosecution  will  remain  in  the</span><span>  same  way  alive  in  spite  of  the  new</span><span>  pains  that  have  come  down  over</span><span>  Jewry.  The  men  who  have  pro</span><span>  duced  all  those  miracles  of  their</span><span>  spirits  have  had  to  go  again  on</span><span>  their  new  travels  throughout  the</span><span>  world.  They  had  to  leave  behind</span><span>  them  their  fortunes,  their  money,</span><span>  even  their  clothes.  But  they  have</span><span>  taken  along  with  themselves  their</span><span>  unbroken  spirit.  That  spirit  wher</span><span>  ever  the  Jews  will  be  driven  out</span><span>  and  wherever  they  will  settle</span><span>  afresh  will  fructify  again  m  inkind</span><span>  for  the  benefit  of  the  human  race</span><span>  and  to  the  honour  of  the  Jewish</span></p> <p><span>  name.</span></p> "

For.  it</span><span>  arose  2,000  years  ago  among  sick,  ex</span><span>  hausted  and  despairing  men,  who  h^d</span><span>  lost,  their  belief  in  life,  \"who  had  des</span><span>  pised  .-the  world,  and  who  waited\"  for</span></p> <p><span>  the  return  of;  Christ  and  the  destruc-  j</span></p> <p><span>  tion  of  .  the  world.</span></p> <p><span>  .4.—The  German  religion  recognises</span><span>  no  dogma,  for  it  is  a  religion.'</span></p> <p><span>  5.—The  German  religion  is  not  a  re</span><span>  ligion  of  revelation  in  the  Christian</span><span>  sense,  \"  it  rests  rather  upon  a  natural</span><span>  revelation  ,of  the  Divine  forces  in  the</span><span>  world  and  in  the  human  mind.</span></p> <p><span>  6.—The  German  religion  is  the  re</span><span>  ligion  of  the  people.  It  has_nothing</span><span>  to  do\"  with  free  througlit,  atheist  pro</span><span>  paganda  and  the  ^disintegration</span><span>  (Zersetzung).  of  reigion.  We.  who  are</span><span>  genuine  .followers  of  German  religion</span><span>  talce  our  stand  on  the  basis  of  a  posi</span><span>  tive  religion.</span></p> <p><span>  Comments:—Where  Christianity</span><span>  stops,  there..our  religion,  begins.  Be</span></p> <p><span>  lief  in  a  personal  God,  in  revelation  ,</span><span>  and  salvation  is  all  superstition,  not</span><span>  religion.  The  biologically  educated</span><span>  man  ,  seeks  the  solution  of  his  moral</span><span>  and  religious  problems  in  the  Cosmos,</span></p> <p><span>  in  nature,-  and  the  world  of  reality,  in  .</span><span>  blood  and  soil,  people  and  home,  na-  j</span></p> <p><span>  tion  and  Fatherland.  Our  religion  is</span></p> <p><span>  no  longer  the  International  Christ-.j</span></p> <p><span>  God  which  could  not  -  prevent  Ver-  'j</span><span>  sailles.  *  Our  religion  isr\"-what  grows  I</span><span>  living  within  us>  the  great,  sacred,</span><span>  glowing  desire  to  wash  away  1,000</span><span>  years  of  German  sorrow,  and  make</span><span>  good  the  sins  of  the  Jewish-Christian</span><span>  alien  religion  against  the  German  soul.</span></p> <p><span>  7.—The  German  religion  is  riot  hos</span><span>  tile  to  a  church.  It  seeks  a  German</span><span>  church  on  the  basis  of  a  religious</span><span>  people.</span></p> <p><span>  8.—God  is  a  moral  idea  to  which  we</span><span>  are  bound  by  the  eternal  creative  force</span><span>  of  nature  which  works  in  the  world</span><span>  and  man.  Belief  in  another-worldly</span><span>  God  is  not  of  Indo-Germanic,  but  of</span><span>  Semitic  origin'.  This-kind  of  God-be</span><span>  lief  is  not  a  condition  of  true  religion</span><span>  and  piety</span></p> <p><span>  9.—In  the  lap  of  \"  the  divine,  living</span><span>  world  the  knowing  being  or  mind</span><span>  grows.  Mind,  is  a  natural  growth  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  .  world  of  reality.  It  is  not  a</span><span>  finished  thing  at  the  height  of  world</span></p> <p><span>  development.</span></p> <p><span>  10.—To  God's  being  belong  will,  un</span><span>  derstanding  (verstand)  and  personal</span><span>  ity.  These  are,  however,  unique  in</span><span>  man.  Hence  man'  is  the  place  (Ort)</span></p> <p><span>  of  God  in  the~  world.</span></p> <p><span>  -  11.—Man  is  not  God.  But  he  is</span><span>  God's  birthplace.  God  exists  and</span><span>  grows  in  man.  If  God  does  not  come</span><span>  in  man,  He  never  comes.  Hence  the</span><span>  German  religion  is  the  religion  of  high</span></p> <p><span>  faith  in  man.</span></p> <p><span>  12.—The  German  religion  recognises</span><span>  no  dualism  .or  conflict-  between  body</span><span>  and  soul,  any  more'than  duality  and</span><span>  conflict  between  God  and  the  world,</span><span>  and  God  and  man.  We  think  of  the</span><span>  being,  body-soul,  as  a  natural  unity</span><span>  and  entity.</span></p> <p><span>  Comments—\"Crucify  thy  flesh,\"</span><span>  was  the  demand  of  the  Esthetic  Chris</span><span>  tian  ethics  of  decadence,  which  over</span><span>  looked  that  at  the  same,  time  the  mind</span><span>  was  crucified.

                        "articleText": "<p><span>  GERMAN</span><span>  MORALE</span></p> <p><span>  One  of  the  most  encouraging  developments</span><span>  of  recent  weeks  has</span><span>  been  tne  increasing  reference  to  the</span><span>  decline  in  (iern.au  morale.  This  is</span><span>  not  the  result  of  wishful  thinking,</span><span>  or  even  inspired  comment  from</span><span>  neutral  sources  who  might  imagine</span><span>  that  we  are  anxious  to  hear  that</span><span>  German  morale  was  declining.  It</span><span>  comes  from  such  authoritative  a</span><span>  source  as  Dr.  Josef  Goebells  himself.</span><span>  Dr.  Goebells  does  not,  of  course,  refer</span><span>  to  it  in  so  many  words,  but  he</span><span>  does  refer  rather  significantly  to</span><span>  '  temporary  weakness,\"  and  he  reiterates</span><span>  with  monotonous  regularity</span><span>  the  fact  that  1918  \"was  a  unique  and</span><span>  tragic  event  in  our  history  which</span><span>  will  not,  and  cannot,  be  repeated.\"</span><span>  It  will  be  remembered  \"-iuuuuuicu  that  mat  in  his  nis</span><span>  ast</span><span>  Herr  Hitler  adopted  the</span><span>  same  lone,  and  very  obviously  the</span><span>  lears  of  1918  are  looming  very  large</span><span>  on  the  German  canvas.  As  a  matter</span><span>  of  fact,  the  differences  between  the</span><span>  present  time  and  1918  are  not  so</span><span>  very  marked.  At  this  stage  of  the</span><span>  last  war,  both  Turkey  and  Bulgaria</span><span>  had  been  forced  out  rather  in  the</span><span>  same  way  as  Italy  has  been  forced</span><span>  out  this  time.  The  crippling  defeats</span><span>  which  the  German  army  is  suffering</span><span>  on  the  eastern  front  were  being  emulated</span><span>  on  the  western  front  of  the</span><span>  last  war.  And  to  this  similarity</span><span>  must  be  added  the  increasing  cost</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  U-boat  campaign,  which</span><span>  is,</span><span>  ,  lor  all  practical  purposes,  as  great</span><span>  a  failure</span><span>  loday</span><span>  as  it  was</span><span>  at</span><span>  the</span><span>  beginning,  of  1918.</span><span>  But  there  is  another</span><span>  and  very  important  difference</span><span>  in</span><span>  the</span><span>  situation—tiie</span><span>  first,</span><span>  which</span><span>  favours</span><span>  the  United  Nations,  is</span><span>  the</span><span>  fact  that  Germany</span><span>  is  being  iiit</span><span>  far</span><span>  harder</span><span>  from  the  air  than  was  possible</span><span>  during  the  last  war.</span><span>  The  second,</span><span>  winch  is  in  favour  of  Germany</span><span>  is</span><span>  the  fact</span><span>  that  the  Nazis  have</span><span>  a</span><span>  much  more  stringent  and  brutal  dis-</span><span>  *  lpunc</span><span>  of</span><span>  the</span><span>  civilian</span><span>  population</span><span>  than  did  the  Kaiser's  Government  of</span><span>  Lie</span><span>  last</span><span>  war.</span><span>  Consequently,</span><span>  u</span><span>  would</span><span>  be  foolish</span><span>  to  anticipate</span><span>  au</span><span>  iitinn  diate  earl  j  collapse  of  the  Cer</span><span>  mans,  although  this  is  by  no  means</span><span>  impossible.</span><span>  It</span><span>  must</span><span>  not,</span><span>  however,</span><span>  be  expected.</span><span>  At  the  same  time  it  looks  very</span><span>  much  as  though  the  German  leaders</span><span>  themselves  are  not  too  hopeful.  This</span><span>  constant  reiteration  of  PJLS  is  an</span><span>  indication  of  how  much  it  is  preying</span><span>  on  their  minds.

But,  within  those</span><span>  limits,  a  self-governing  Ger?jp</span><span>  State  has  been  brought  into</span><span>  being  by  the  Western  Powers.</span><span>  It  is  a  fateful  experiment.  The</span><span>  willingness  and  capacity  of  the</span><span>  German  people  to  make  a  re</span><span>  presentative  parliamentary  sys</span><span>  tem  work,  which  has  already</span><span>  failed  once  in  the  destruction  of</span><span>  the  Weimar  Republic  by  Hitler's</span><span>  Nazism,  is  again  being  put  to</span><span>  the  test  in  a  very  difficult  post</span><span>  war  stage.  The  outcome,</span><span>  politically  and  economically,</span><span>  will  have  a  profound  influence</span><span>  on  the  future  of  Europe  and</span><span>  the  task  of  Dr.  Adenauer  as</span><span>  the  first  Chancellor,  is  one  of</span><span>  the  gravest  responsibility.  The</span><span>  return  of  germany  to  a  proper</span><span>  place  in  the  European  and</span><span>  world  community  has  been</span><span>  facilitated  by  the  Western</span><span>  Powers.  But  there  will  be  need</span><span>  for  sound  evidence  of  German</span><span>  attachment  to  peaceable  demo</span><span>  cratic  practice  and  of  a  genu</span><span>  inely  cooperative  spirit  to</span><span>  justify  the  next  step,  which</span><span>  would  presumably  be  admis</span><span>  sion  to  the  Council  of  Europe.</span><span>  The  greatest  danger,  as  always</span><span>  in  German  politics,  must  come</span><span>  from  the  lack  of  any  ingrained</span><span>  parliamentary  tradition  and  the</span><span>  struggle  of  extremists  on  the</span><span>  right  and  the  left  to  overthrow</span><span>  the  moderate  democrats  and</span><span>  seize  authoritarian  power.  A</span><span>  stabilising  factor,  however,  is</span><span>  that  the  two  major  parties-the</span><span>  Christian  Democrats  in  office</span><span>  and  the  Social  Democrats  in</span><span>  opposition-stand  firmly  for</span><span>  constitutional  and  democratic</span><span>  principles.  The  Christian</span><span>  Democrats,  although  the  larg</span><span>  est  party  in  the  Federal  Lower</span><span>  House,  have  only  139  seats  out</span><span>  of  402.  Under  Dr.  Aden</span><span>  auer's  leadership  they  de</span><span>  clined  to  seek  a  Government</span><span>  with  the  Social  Democrats  (131</span><span>  seats)  because  of  deep  divisions</span><span>  on  economic  policy.  Dr.  Aden</span><span>  auer  therefore  looked  to  the</span><span>  smaller  parties  on  his  right</span><span>  and  he  has  formed  a  coalition</span><span>  with  the  conservative  .  Free</span><span>  Democrats  and  the  strongly</span><span>  nationalist  German  Party.  It</span><span>  is  a  coalition,  however,  which</span><span>  has  an  extremely  narrow  ma</span><span>  jority.  Dr.  Adenauer's  pro</span><span>  blem,  in  which  the  Western</span><span>  Powers  have  an  acute  and  ap</span><span>  prehensive  interest,  will  be  to</span><span>  resist  dictation  from  the  right</span><span>  and  to  hold  in  check  the  re</span><span>  vival  of  nationalism  which  was</span><span>  so  strongly  marked  in  the  elec</span><span>  tion.</span></p> "

This  is  an  import</span><span>  ant  factor  to  be  reckoned  with</span><span>  in  the  urgent  and  complex</span><span>  problem  of  revitalising  food</span><span>  production.  Even  if  Britain</span><span>  were  not  herself  engaged  in  a</span><span>  vigorous  drive  for  more  out</span><span>  put  from  the  land,  the  com</span><span>  petition  from  other  overseas</span><span>  countries  is  such  that  Austra</span><span>  lia  would  still  have  to  turn  to</span><span>  Europe  for  agricultural  mi</span><span>  grants.  There,  too,  post-war</span><span>  rehabilitation  has  reduced  the</span><span>  small  proportion  which  farm</span><span>  workers  represent  in  the</span><span>  pool  of  potential  migrants.</span><span>  But  there  is  a  surplus  of</span><span>  landless  farming  people  in</span><span>  West  Germany  for  special  rea</span><span>  sons  emphasised  by  the  mem</span><span>  bers  of  the  West  German</span><span>  Federal  Migration  Board  now</span><span>  visiting  Western  Australia  on</span><span>  an  exploratory  mission.  The</span><span>  Commonwealth  Govern</span><span>  ment's  move  towards  accept</span><span>  ance  of  a  quota  of  selec</span><span>  ted  Germans  under  a  negotia</span><span>  ted  migration  agreement</span><span>  like  that  with  Italy-gives</span><span>  Australia  a  chance  to  recruit</span><span>  agricultural  workers.  For</span><span>  West  Germany  it  offers  some</span><span>  relief  in  the  problem  of  pro</span><span>  viding  for  an  influx  of  nearly</span><span>  10,000,000  people  who  are</span><span>  either  victims  of  Communist</span><span>  expulsion  from  the  Russian</span><span>  dominated  territories  or  fugi</span><span>  tives  from  Communist  terror.</span><span>  Nothing  but  prejudice  need</span><span>  stand  in  the  way  of  working</span><span>  out  an  arrangement  for</span><span>  mutual  advantage.</span><span>  If  we  have  to  go  outside</span><span>  Britain  for  population  we</span><span>  naturally  look  first  along  the</span><span>  Western  European  seaboard</span><span>  for  assimilable  racial  stock</span><span>  most  akin  to  our  own.  In</span><span>  the  aftermath  of  the  war</span><span>  there  have  been  great  changes</span><span>  in  Germany  and  also  in  the</span><span>  Western  attitude  to  the  Ger</span><span>  man  people  and  their  future</span><span>  in  the  free  world.  An  at</span><span>  tempt  is  being  made  to  build</span><span>  up  a  friendly  and  peaceful</span><span>  cooperation  and,  at  the  same</span><span>  time,  circumstances  have  pro</span><span>  duced  a  new  period  of  Ger</span><span>  man  readiness  to  migrate.  In</span><span>  South  Australia,  particularly,</span><span>  there  is  experience  of  how  an</span><span>  earlier  generation  of  German</span><span>  settlers  showed  a  capacity  to</span><span>  identify  themselves  with  the</span><span>  life  and  institutions  of  their</span><span>  adopted  country.</span><span>  Any  German  migration  now</span><span>  could  amount  to  only  a  micro</span><span>  scopic  percentage  of  the</span><span>  Australian  population  and,</span><span>  should  any  political  or  other</span><span>  undesirables  slip  through  the</span><span>  screen,  they  could  always</span><span>  be  sent  back  on  proof  of</span><span>  subversion  or  misconduct.</span><span>  There  would  be  no  need  for</span><span>  costly  land  settlement  ven</span><span>  tures.  Concentration  on  Ger</span><span>  man  farmers  or  farm-workers</span><span>  willing  to  take  agricultural</span><span>  jobs-perhaps  under  some</span><span>  limited  contract-would  im</span><span>  pose  a  minimum  strain  on</span><span>  housing.  Employed  on  farms</span><span>  they  could  gain  experience</span><span>  of  Australian  conditions  and</span><span>  work  towards  small  farms  of</span><span>  their  own.</span></p> "

Why,  then,  is  the</span><span>  charge  made?  It  is  made  not  only</span><span>  by  our  correspondent  but,  from  time</span><span>  to  time,  by  others  too.  I  attended</span><span>  the  exhibition  at  the  Kadimah  on  the</span><span>  occasion*  of  the  tenth  anniversary  0i</span><span>  the  Warsaw  Ghetto  revolt.

You  will  find</span><span>  some  people  who  will  tell  you  that  the</span><span>  assimilation  for  which  German  Jews</span><span>  were  notorious  will  always  make</span><span>  them  indifferent  to  the  community’s</span><span>  problems.  But  against  this  it  is  pos</span><span>  sible  to  cite  many  examples  of  devoted</span><span>  Jewish  service  by  German  Jews.

And</span><span>  although  West  Australians</span><span>  have  become  accustomed  to</span><span>  European  migration,  doubt</span><span>  less  many  of  them  will  be  a</span><span>  little  curious  about  these  new</span><span>  Australians  whose  homeland</span><span>  has  altered  the  course  of  world</span><span>  history  and  may  do  so  again.</span><span>  There  need  be  no  misunder</span><span>  standings.  Australia  is  not</span><span>  exactly  an  earthly  paradise  but</span><span>  the  Germans  who  have  come</span><span>  to  our  shores  are  fortunate</span><span>  people  and  we,  in  turn,  should</span><span>  be  glad  to-have  them.  We  can</span><span>  afford  to  forget  past  animosi</span><span>  ties  and  Hitler's  misdeeds  but,</span><span>  if  we  cannot  completely  .erase</span><span>  them,  we  should  take  a  broad</span><span>  view  of  history  and  recollect</span><span>  that  Wellington  prayed  for</span><span>  Blucher's  arrival  at  Waterloo.</span><span>  Australia,  after  all,  is  not  so</span><span>  remote  from  the  world's  great</span><span>  populations  and  if  it  is  to</span><span>  accept  the  challenge  of  the</span><span>  new  Asia  it  will  have  need  for</span><span>  the  German  qualities  of  indus</span><span>  try,  fortitude  and  discipline.</span><span>  In  our  factories,  mines  and</span><span>  laboratories  and  on  our  farms</span><span>  there  is  also  a  place  for  Ger</span><span>  man  intelligence  and  in</span><span>  genuity.  South  Australia  has</span><span>  good,  reason  to  be  thankful  to</span><span>  its  early  German  settlers  and</span><span>  it  should  be  our  hope  that,  in</span><span>  years  to  come,  we  shall  be  able</span><span>  to  look  upon  a  comparable</span><span>  German  contribution  to  the</span><span>  vr..n?ress  of  Western  Aus</span><span>  tralia.</span></p> "

Of  the  Germans  with</span><span>  whom  he  comes  into  closer  contact,  the  Jew  won</span><span>  ders:  is  the  hand  I  am  shaking  the  hand  of  one</span><span>  of  the  butchers?</span></p> <p><span>  Naturally,  the  intensity  of  this  reaction  is</span><span>  blunted  after  a  while,  but  there  remains  a  residue</span><span>  very  near  the  surface  that  colours  every  moment</span><span>  of  the  stay  in  Germany.</span></p> <p><span>  So.  of  course,  the  relation</span><span>  ship  between  German  and</span><span>  Jew  Is  bound  to  be  an  ab</span><span>  normal  one.  Nearly  all  the</span><span>  Germans  I  met  during  my</span><span>  visit  felt  it  necessary  to</span><span>  make  some  expression  —  from</span><span>  the  eloquent  to  the  hesitant</span><span>  —  of  their  sense  of  guilt  for</span><span>  the  Nazi  past,  and  to  add</span><span>  some  words  explaining  their</span><span>  own  innocence.  Many  of  them</span><span>  were,  undoubtedly,  both  truth,</span><span>  ful  and  sincere,  but  yet  I  felt</span><span>  that  to  some  extent  even  they</span><span>  resented  being  reminded  of</span><span>  something  they  would  much</span><span>  rather  forget.</span></p> <p><span>  For  my  part,  at  each  of</span><span>  these  encounters  I  could  not</span><span>  avoid  a  feeling  of  some  dis</span><span>  comfort  at  being  the  cause</span><span>  of  shame  and  embarrassment</span><span>  on  the  part  of  these  apparent,</span><span>  ly  decent  Germans.  Yet  I</span><span>  know  that  I  would  have  taken</span><span>  amiss  the  absence  of  their</span><span>  expression  of  guilt  and  of</span><span>  explanation.  I  cannot  but  feel</span><span>  that  this  reaction  of  German</span><span>  and  Jew  will  continue  through,</span><span>  out  the  lives  of  the  genera</span><span>  tion  who  was  involved.</span></p> <p><span>  NO  TRADITION</span></p> <p><span>  The  present  abnormality  in</span><span>  the  relationships  between</span><span>  Germans  and  Jews  was,</span><span>  therefore,  responsible  for  a</span><span>  certain  tension  during  my</span><span>  visit  But  Germany  (like  Is</span><span>  rael).  is  a  country  in  which</span><span>  a  great  deal  is  going  on,  and</span><span>  the  interest  in  observing  this</span><span>  regeneration  overlays  though</span><span>  it  never  entirely  displaces,  the</span><span>  I  sense  of  discomfort</span></p> <p><span>  Certainly,  the  Wirtschafts</span><span>  wunder  —  the  miracle  of</span><span>  German  economic  recovery’—■</span><span>  is  all  nervading.  Shops  are</span><span>  not  only  full  of  expensive</span><span>  merchandise,  they  are  busily</span><span>  selling  it</span></p> <p><span>  Innumerable  and  varied</span><span>  eating  establishments  dispense</span><span>  gargantuan  servings  of  whole</span><span>  some  food  to  portly  diners.</span><span>  New  construction,  skyscrapers,</span><span>  houses,  public  buildings,  trans</span><span>  form  derelict  bombed  sites.</span><span>  The  men  and  women  in  the</span><span>  street  are  patently  well-fed</span><span>  and  well-clothed.</span></p> <p><span>  TENSION</span></p> <p><span>  This  abundant  prosperity</span><span>  has  obvious  implications  for</span><span>  the  prospect  for  democracy</span><span>  in  Germany.  So  long  as  it</span><span>  lasts,  the  German  man-in-the</span><span>  street  will  be  content  with</span><span>  the  Government  which  pro</span><span>  vides  these  benefits.</span></p> <p><span>  But  Germany  has  no  tra</span><span>  dition  of  democracy.  Its</span><span>  citizens  have  been  condition</span><span>  ed  to  respond  to  authoritar</span><span>  ian  leadership.</span></p> <p><span>  One  of  the  many  everyday</span><span>  examples,  is  the  exaggerated</span><span>  difference  still  accorded  to</span><span>  uniforms  and  titles.  I  have</span><span>  no  doubt  that  the'  present</span><span>  administration  has  a  sincere</span><span>  desire  to  establish  a  soundly</span><span>  based  democratic  system  in;</span><span>  Germany  and  today’s  pros</span><span>  perity  is  helping  to  achieve</span></p> <p><span>  it.</span></p> <p><span>  But  should  there  be  a</span><span>  serious  economic  or  political</span><span>  crisis,  a  new  type  of  total</span><span>  litarianlsm  might  very  well</span><span>  emerge.  As  a  leading  trade</span><span>  unionist  put  •  it  to  me.  “I</span><span>  would  not  put  my  hand  in</span><span>  the  fire  for  German  democ</span><span>  racy.”</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  a  pity  that  many  who</span><span>  understand  the  fragility  of</span><span>  German  democracy  try  to:</span></p> <p><span>  protect  it  by  over-emphasis</span><span>  upon  the  fight  against  former</span><span>  Nazis.  Undoubtedly  their  re</span><span>  tention  in  positions  of  ap</span><span>  parent  influence  exercises  a</span><span>  harmful  effect  on  public</span><span>  opinion.-A  new  totalitarian</span><span>  ism,  however,  can  be  brought</span><span>  about  by  a  wave  of  emotion</span><span>  alism  and  anti-rationalism</span><span>  that  may  flare  up  In  a  crisis.</span><span>  The  new  right  vsdng  radical</span><span>  parties  are  the  ones  to  watch.</span><span>  By  diverting  energies  to  the</span><span>  proscription  of  old  Nazis</span><span>  (who  will  not  be  the  new</span><span>  Nazis)  the  real  sources  of  the</span><span>  future  danger  may  be</span><span>  ignored.</span></p> <p><span>  EDUCATION</span></p> <p><span>  What,  therefore,  can  be</span><span>  done  so  that  a  new  Germany</span><span>  does  not  ever  again  become</span><span>  militaristic,  nationalistic  and</span><span>  racist?  The  education  of  the</span><span>  rising  generation  in  democ</span><span>  ratic  ways  and  to  a  realisa</span><span>  tion  of  the  crimes  of  Nazism</span><span>  is  not  a  complete  Insurance</span><span>  against  another  recession  into</span><span>  savagery  (nothing  is),  but  it</span><span>  is  an  aspect  than  can  only  be</span><span>  neglected  at  the  nation’s  peril.</span></p> <p><span>  I  believed  the  German</span><span>  educationists  who  told  me</span><span>  what  they  were  trying  to  do,</span><span>  for  they  were  enlightened  and</span><span>  Intelligent  people.  Ideal  cur</span><span>  ricula  are  drawn  up  but  they</span><span>  might  never  be  applied  in</span><span>  practice  because  of  opposi</span><span>  tion  by  parents  and  teachers</span><span>  who,  naturally,  want  to  avoid</span><span>  the  discovery  of  their  own</span><span>  guilt  to  the  children.</span></p> <p><span>  As  the  opinions  I  heard</span><span>  of  the  effectiveness  of  the</span><span>  schools  programme  were  so</span><span>  varied,  I  decided  to  make  my,</span><span>  own  test</span></p> <p><span>  Without  anyone  else  being</span><span>  present.  I  met  the  top  classes</span><span>  of  two  schools.  One  was  a</span><span>  grammar  school  and  the</span><span>  average  age  of  the  boys  was</span><span>  17.  They  all  had  a  fairly</span><span>  good  knowledge  of  the  origins</span><span>  and  rise  of  Hitlerism.  They</span><span>  knew  something  about  the</span><span>  causes  of  the  war  and  of</span><span>  Hitler’s  invasion  of  neutral</span><span>  countries  (though  they  thought</span><span>  it  was  justified  in  a  “total</span><span>  war”).  And  they  knew  about</span><span>  the  persecution  of  the  Jews,</span><span>  (the  reason  —  they  were  ter</span><span>  i  ribly  rich  and  Hitler  wanted</span></p> <p><span>  their  money  to  start  a  war),</span><span>  though  not  of  other  minor</span><span>  ities.</span></p> <p><span>  NAZIS</span></p> <p><span>  Most  of  their  parents  had</span><span>  been  Nazis,  but  had  explained</span><span>  their  membership  to  their</span><span>  children  as  having  been  due</span><span>  to  economic  reasons  such  as</span><span>  employment  and  getting  school</span><span>  places.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  second  school,  which</span><span>  approximates  more  to  our</span><span>  secondary  modern,  I  spoke  to</span><span>  the  top  class  of  boys  who</span><span>  were  about  15  year  old.  They</span><span>  knew  very  little  about  Hitler</span><span>  and  the  war  but  they  all</span><span>  knew  the  figure  of  six  mil</span><span>  lion  Jews  who  had  been</span><span>  killed.  I  gathered,  however,</span><span>  that  they  had  learned  this</span><span>  from  television  and  not  from</span><span>  school.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Cologne  swastika</span><span>  smearing  of  December,  1959,</span><span>  came  as  a  profound  shock  to</span><span>  liberal  elements  in  Germany</span><span>  and  the  repercussions  are  by</span></p> <p><span>  no  means  ended.</span></p> <p><span>  One  was  a  recognition  that</span><span>  the  educational  programme</span><span>  had  been  allowed  to  drift</span></p> <p><span>  almost  into  stagnation  Educ</span><span>  ation  is  a  responsibility  of  the</span><span>  Laender  not  the  Federal</span><span>  Government  “Controversial”</span><span>  issues,  like  the  teaching  of</span><span>  Germany’s  past,  are  suscept</span><span>  ible  to  local  pressure,  and</span><span>  that  Is  one  of  the  reasons  why</span><span>  more  has  not  been  done.  Ef</span><span>  forts  have  been  unsuccessful</span><span>  to  establish  a  Federal  Minis</span><span>  try  of  Education  which  might</span><span>  be  expected  to  tackle  the  sub</span><span>  ject  with  greater  vigour.  Since</span><span>  this  is  unlikely  to  come  about</span><span>  for  political  -  and  practical</span><span>  reasons,  there  ought  to  be</span><span>  some  effective  system  of</span><span>  school  inspection  to  ensure</span><span>  that  the  syllabus  approved</span><span>  bv  enlightened  Ministers  of</span><span>  Education  is.  in  fact,  applied</span><span>  in  lessons  and  that  teachers</span><span>  do  not  plead  lack  of  time  in</span><span>  stopping  the  teaching  of  Ger</span><span>  man  history  at  1914.</span></p> <p><span>  (To  be  concluded.)</span></p> <p><span>  (Copyright,  Jewish  Chron</span><span>  icle  Feature  &  News  Service.)</span></p> "

They  are  met  by  a</span><span>  “\\vall  of  silence”.  Says  Ben</span><span>  Chorin:  “Those  who  don’t</span></p> <p><span>  want  to  share  the  guiltj  of</span></p> <p><span>  their  fathers  feel  some  need</span><span>  to  move  from  the.  camp  of</span><span>  the  persecutor  to  the  camp</span><span>  of  the  persecuted...”</span></p> <p><span>  This,  I  think,.  must  be</span></p> <p><span>  cepted  as  a  pretty  true  pic</span><span>  ture  of  a  large  section  of</span><span>  German  youth  today.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  the  verdict  of  Gud</span><span>  ilin  Tempel  in  her  passion</span><span>  ately  sincere  book  “Speak</span><span>  ing  Frankly  About  The  Ger</span><span>  mans”,  and  it  is  the  verdict</span><span>  of  the  investigation  which</span><span>  we  saw  on  our  Television</span><span>  sets'a  few  weeks  ago  where</span><span>  every  young  German  said,</span><span>  in  effect:  “...  We  cannot</span><span>  talk  to  our  parents...  Nor</span><span>  can  we  believe  that  they</span><span>  didn’t  know  what  was  hap</span><span>  pening  ..</span></p> <p><span>  Young  Germans  have</span><span>  come  into  direct  Jewish  con</span><span>  tact  due  to  the  co-operation</span><span>  between  various  Israeli  and</span><span>  German  youth  organisa</span><span>  tions.  Perhaps  they  feel  a</span><span>  need  to  expiate  the  sins  of</span><span>  their  fathers.  Perhaps  it  is</span><span>  merely  the  most  violent  re</span><span>  bellion  they  can  make</span><span>  against.  the  standards  of</span><span>  their  fathers.</span></p> <p><span>  t^|7^HATEVER  the  rensons,</span></p> <p><span>  according  ,  to  this  ar</span><span>  ticle,'  the  conversions  go  on.</span><span>  The  Rabbis  treat  them  with</span><span>  more  than  reserve.  The</span><span>  training  period  is  so  long</span><span>  that  only  the  most  deter</span><span>  mined  survive  the  delay.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Rabbis  are  of  course</span><span>  extremely  reluctant  in  the</span><span>  case  of  older  Germans,  but</span><span>  the  young  ones  they  cannot</span><span>  reject.  In  one  group  alone,</span><span>  in  Hamburg,  Hr.  Ben-Cho</span><span>  rin  met  ten  young  Germans</span><span>  in  process  of  being  convert</span></p> <p><span>  ed.

It  is  a</span><span>  purely  religious  swing  away</span><span>  from  the  conception  of  the</span><span>  Trinity  —  a  return  and  a</span><span>  need  for  a  monotheistic  God.</span></p> <p><span>  Even  various  •  Theological</span><span>  Colleges;  that  previously  re</span><span>  jected  Judaism  as  the  moth</span><span>  er  religion  from  which</span><span>  Christianity  came,  have  now</span><span>  changed  their  teachings  to</span><span>  acknowledge  that  Christia</span><span>  nity  owes  the  greater  part</span></p> <p><span>  of  its  teaching  to  the  parent</span><span>  religion.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  of  course  easy  to  see</span><span>  in  a  fragmentary  German</span><span>  desire  to  embrace  Judaism  a</span><span>  great  deal  more  than  it  war</span><span>  rants.  Psychologists  will  see</span><span>  in  it  a  murderer’s  desire  to</span><span>  embrace  the  body  of  the  vic</span><span>  tim,  or  a  guilt  expiation  at</span></p> <p><span>  Yet  it  isn’t  likely  that</span><span>  Jewish  religious  authorities</span><span>  will  welcome  these  converts</span><span>  with  great  joy.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  something  a  little</span><span>  unhealthy  in  this  converting</span><span>  impulse.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Germans  —  on  the</span><span>  other  side  of  the  coin  that</span><span>  shows  brutality  and  sadism</span><span>  —have  always  had  a  mas</span><span>  ochistic  streak  as  well.  It</span><span>  could  be  that  this  rejection</span><span>  of  their  parents’  standards</span><span>  is  an  example  of  this  char</span><span>  acteristic.</span></p> <p><span>  Whatever  the  causes,  Mr.</span><span>  Ben-Chorin’s  story  fits  a</span><span>  new  piece  into  the  jig-saw</span><span>  puzzle  that  is  Germany  to</span><span>  day.  .</span></p> "

Returning  to  Adelaide,  he</span><span>  soon  established  two  committees  to  in</span><span>  vestigate  the  implementation  of  worker</span><span>  participation  in  the  management  of  pub</span><span>  lic  authorities  and  private  industry  in</span><span>  South  Australia.

Trades  &  Labor  Council.</span><span>  Machinery  for  worker  participation  in</span><span>  management  has  been  introduced  by</span><span>  government  legislation  in  West  Germany</span><span>  on  a  wider  scale  than  any  other  ad</span><span>  vanced  capitalist  country.  With  Chris</span><span>  tian  Democratic  Union  and  Social  De</span><span>  mocratic  Party  support  the  Codetermina-</span><span>  tion  Law  was  passed  in  1951,  under</span><span>  which  the  practice  was  instituted  in  the</span><span>  coal  and  steel  industries.  Further  legis</span><span>  lation  in  the  following  year  gave  legal</span><span>  status  to  worker  participation  in  man</span><span>  agement  in  all  private  and  public  com</span><span>  panies.</span><span>  The  ideology  built  around  codetermina-</span><span>  tion,  known  as  Mitbestimmung,  was  an</span><span>  attempt  to  narrow  political  and  econo</span><span>  mic  differences  between  management</span><span>  and  worker  to  compel  them  to  collabor</span><span>  ate  in  the  factory,  thus  opening  the  way</span><span>  to  the  harmonious  social  and  economic</span><span>  reconstruction  of  postwar  West  Ger</span><span>  many.  As  Herbert  J.  Spiro  wrote  in</span><span>  The  Politics  of  German  Codetermination</span><span>  (Harvard  University  Press,  1958):  \"Co-</span><span>  determination  became  a  vast  educational</span><span>  scheme  designed,  over  a  period  of  years,</span><span>  to  raise  the  workers'  level  of  understand</span><span>  ing  and  thereby  to  help  bring  about  so</span><span>  cial  peace  and  thus-  reduce  the  extent</span><span>  of  the  sphere  of  political  conflict,  or  at</span><span>  least  its  violence\",  (p.  8).</span><span>  The  evidence  shows  clearly  that  par</span><span>  ticipation  leads  to  close  identification</span><span>  with  management.  To  quote  from  Adolph</span><span>  Sturmthal's  Workers'  Control  (Harvard</span><span>  University  Press,  1964):  \"But  the  change</span><span>  was  not  automatically  one  to  a  system</span><span>  of  democratic  partnership  but  rather  to</span><span>  joint  paternalism.  The  significant  fact</span><span>  is  that  in  many  cases  the  works'  coun</span><span>  cil  has  joined  in  the  system  and  has  be</span><span>  come  a  partner  in  a  management  team</span><span>  which  administers  the  labor  force  of  the</span><span>  enterprise  with  authority  and  benevol</span><span>  ence.\"  (p.  68).</span><span>  It  is  clear  that  managers  in  Germany</span><span>  regard  worker  participation  in  manage</span><span>  ment  as  a  means  to  reduce  the  influence</span><span>  of  unions  inside  the  factory,  thereby  re</span><span>  ducing  the  ability  of  workers  to  unite</span><span>  in  presenting  demands  to  management.</span><span>  The  famous  labour  lawyer  and  political</span><span>  scientist  Franz  Neumann  wrote  in  Ger</span><span>  many  and  the  Future  of  Europe,  edited</span><span>  by  Hans  J.  Morgenthau  (University  of</span><span>  Chicago  Press,  1952):  \"It  has  become  in</span><span>  creasingly  doubtful  to  me  if  any  program</span><span>  of  codetermination  is  viable  and  desir</span><span>  able,  and  I  have  become  more  and  more</span></p> <p><span>  convinced  that  in  reality  the  program</span><span>  far  from  achieving  anything,  may  actu</span><span>  ally  destroy  the  little  militancy  that  is</span><span>  left  in  the  German  labor  movement.\"  (p.</span><span>  103).</span><span>  Participation  in  management  in  capi</span><span>  talist  countries  is  essentially  an  experi</span><span>  ence.  that  mystifies  the  workers  as  to</span><span>  their  real  position.  Real  power  in  West</span><span>  Germany  has  not  been  placed  in  the</span><span>  hands  of  the  workers.  Management  still</span><span>  take  all  important  policy  decisions;  the</span><span>  factories  are  still  owned  by  the  share</span><span>  holders;  the  workers  are  still  hired  labor.</span><span>  Mitbestimmung  is  a  capitalist  theory  of</span><span>  industrial  democracy,  the  latest  attempt</span><span>  to  abandon  the  notion  of  class  struggle</span><span>  and  to  entice  the  workers  away  from</span><span>  socialism.</span><span>  Understandably,  it  holds  considerable</span><span>  attraction  for  the  technocratic  Premier</span><span>  of  South  Australia  who  informed  the  Na</span><span>  tional  Youth  Council  in  1969  that  \"pri</span><span>  vate  enterprise  is  a  meaningless  phrase\"</span><span>  and  who  asserted  before  the  American</span><span>  Chamber  of  Commerce  in  Australia  in</span><span>  1970  that  the  appropriation  of  private</span><span>  capital  was  a  \"totally  discredited  idea.\"</span></p> "

and</span><span>  being  so  unable  to  help  themselves.</span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  Israel’s  growing</span><span>  reluctance  to  return  the</span><span>  territories  occupied  in  1967</span><span>  in  return  for  Arab</span><span>  recognition  of  the  Jewish</span><span>  state  is  likewise  an  ob-</span><span>  stacle.</span></p> <p><span>  There  can  be  little  doubt</span><span>  that  Israel’s  policy  in</span></p> <p><span>  recent  years  has  been</span><span>  based  on  a  feeling  of  such</span><span>  military  superiority  over</span><span>  the  other  side  that</span><span>  Jerusalem  was  intent  on</span></p> <p><span>  itself  deciding  the  form</span><span>  possible  negotiations  were</span><span>  to  take  and  the  extent  to</span><span>  which  they  were  to  go.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Arab  governments</span><span>  have  not  played  ball,  and</span><span>  even  if  they  and  Israel  had</span><span>  reached  agreement  on</span><span>  negotiations  there  would</span><span>  still  be  the  Palestinians,</span><span>  who  are  operating  in-</span><span>  creasingly  independently  and</span></p> <p><span>  ever  more  intently  on</span><span>  destroying  the  Jewish</span><span>  State.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Palestinians  (and  for</span><span>  long  enough  the  Arab,</span><span>  governments  too)  have</span><span>  invariably  counted  on</span><span>  massive  Soviet  support,</span><span>  much  as  Israel  has  relied</span><span>  on  continuing  aid  from  the</span><span>  United  States.</span></p> <p><span>  In  Cairo  and  Damascus,</span><span>  not  to  mention  other  Arab</span><span>  capitals,  growing  doubts</span></p> <p><span>  have  for.  some  time  arisen</span><span>  as  to  the  disinterested</span><span>  nature  of  Soviet  support.</span><span>  There  was  an  uneasy  and</span><span>  not  entirely  unjustifiable</span><span>  feeling  that  continuation  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  current  situation</span><span>  midway  between  war  and</span><span>  peace  was  probably  most</span><span>  in  accord  with  Soviet  in-</span><span>  terests  and  intentions.</span></p> <p><span>  Israel,  on  the  other  hand,</span><span>  has  thus  far  shunned</span><span>  serious  consideration  of  the</span><span>  prospect  of  a  change  in</span><span>  relations  with  its  major</span><span>  ally.</span></p> <p><span>  Over  the  past  year  it  may</span><span>  have  grown  obvious  enough</span><span>  that  the  United  States  is</span></p> <p><span>  heading  towards  an  energy</span><span>  crisis  that  will  no  longer</span><span>  allow  it  to  enter  into  major</span><span>  conflict  with  the  Arab  oil</span><span>  exporting  countries,  yet</span><span>  Mrs.  Meir’s  government</span><span>  seems  unwilling  to</span><span>  acknowledge  that  the</span><span>  resulting  political  con-</span><span>  sequences  for  Israel  could</span><span>  prove  unforeseeable.</span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  MUTUAL</span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  At  all  events  there  are</span><span>  growing  indications  that</span><span>  Washington  is  at  least  as</span><span>  strongly  interested  in</span><span>  detente  with  the  Soviet</span><span>  Union  and  unhindered</span><span>  petroleum  supplies  as  it  is</span><span>  in  good  relations  with</span><span>  Israel.</span></p> <p><span>  This  being  the  case,  there</span><span>  is  little  point  in  concluding</span><span>  a  new  armistice  agree-</span><span>  ment  in  the  Middle  East</span><span>  without  at  the  same  time</span><span>  making  a  genuine  attempt</span><span>  to  reach  fundamental</span></p> <p><span>  solutions  —  an  attempt</span><span>  that  must  be  made  by</span></p> <p><span>  both  sides.</span></p> <p><span>  Israel  will  not,  of  course,</span><span>  want,  to  hear  anything  of</span><span>  the  necessity,  and  it  will  be</span><span>  up  to  the  Arab  govern-</span></p> <p><span>  ments  to

We</span><span>  want  to  push  for  the  development  of</span><span>  reconciliation  and  peace,”  says  20</span><span>  year-old  Christianna  Dahm  of  Col</span><span>  ogne,  a  volunteer  for  Action  for</span><span>  Reconciliation  and  Peace  Services,  a</span><span>  group  of  young  Germans  whose  goal</span><span>  is  to  encourage  reconciliation  be</span><span>  tween  Germany  and  countries  that</span></p> <p><span>  suffered  under  the  Nazis.</span></p> <p><span>  The  group  has  160  volunteers  in</span><span>  nine  countries.  Nearly  a  quarter  of</span><span>  the  volunteers  work  in  Israel.  The</span></p> <p><span>  idea  for  the  original  organization</span><span>  came  out  of  a  discussion  by  German</span><span>  Protestant  clergymen,  led  by  Lothar</span><span>  Kreissig  in  the  late  Fifties,  who  “were</span><span>  looking  for  a  way  to  overcome  the</span><span>  problems  of  relations  between  Ger</span><span>  mans  and  other  nations  as  a  result  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  war  and  the  Holocaust,”  says</span><span>  Dahm.</span></p> <p><span>  In  Israel  the  organization  concen</span><span>  trates  on  working  with  the  elderly  -</span><span>  particularly  German-  and  Yiddish</span><span>  speaking  persons  who  were  the</span></p> <p><span>  direct  victims  of  Nazism  -  as  well  as</span><span>  with  handicapped  children.  Volun</span><span>  teer  jobs  include  teching  extra</span><span>  curricular  subjects,  tutoring,  work  in</span><span>  homes  for  the  aged  and  home  visits</span><span>  to  the  elderly.</span></p> <p><span>  Action  for  Reconciliation  is  an</span><span>  18-month  programme,  although  a</span><span>  West  German  law  just  passed  and</span><span>  lengthening  army  service  will  mean</span></p> <p><span>  new  male  volunteers  will  in  future</span></p> <p><span>  participate  for  two  years  if  they</span><span>  choose  to  join  the  Action  group  and</span><span>  thus  fulfil  their  national  service  re</span></p> <p><span>  quirement  as  an  alternative  to  army</span><span>  service.  The  programme  begins  with</span></p> <p><span>  a  one-month  seminar  in  West</span></p> <p><span>  Gemany,  which  includes  visits  to</span><span>  concentration  camps,  work  in  the</span><span>  camp  museums  and  discussions  with</span></p> <p><span>  former  inmates.</span></p> <p><span>  The  volunteers  then  go  to  the</span><span>  country  of  their  choice.  The  Israeli</span><span>  contingent  spends  the  first  three</span><span>  months  in  a  work-language-study</span><span>  programme  on,  a  kibbutz  before</span><span>  being  sent  to  serve  in  institutions</span></p> <p><span>  around  the  country.  In  most  cases,</span><span>  the  institution  provides  room  and</span><span>  board,  and  sometimes,  pocket</span><span>  money.  If  it  can’t  afford  that  and</span><span>  Action  officials  think  it’s  important</span><span>  enough,  the  organization  foots  the</span><span>  bill,  but  resources  are  limited.</span></p> <p><span>  Two-thirds  of  the  organization’s</span><span>  national  budget  comes  from  private</span></p> <p><span>  donations.</span></p> <p><span>  The  volunteers  say  they  rarely</span><span>  encounter  anti-German  feeling</span><span>  here,  although  they  say  earlier</span><span>  groups  had  more  problems,  and</span></p> <p><span>  some  kibbutzim  still  refuse  to  take</span><span>  German  volunteers.  On  the  other</span></p> <p><span>  hand,  many  of  the  elderly  with</span><span>  whom  they  work  feel  more  comfort</span><span>  able  speaking  German  than  Hebrew</span><span>  and  still  feel  an  attachment  to  Ger</span><span>  man  culture.</span></p> <p><span>  “it’s  the  second  generation  that  is</span><span>  more  of  a  problem,”  says  28-year</span></p> <p><span>  old  Einat  Weiss,  housemother  at  a</span><span>  seminar  centre  serving  the  volun</span><span>  teers,  who  explains  that  the  Israeli</span><span>  born  children  of  refugees  or  Holo</span><span>  caust  survivors  see  only  the  negative</span><span>  side  of  Germany  while  the  parents</span><span>  remember  “another”  Germany.</span></p> <p><span>  Ironically,  Israel’s  economic</span></p> <p><span>  crunch  has  made  it  harder  for  the</span><span>  Germans  to  find  suitable  volunteer</span><span>  work.</span></p> <p><span>  Apart  from  having  contact  with</span><span>  kibbutz  members,  the  volunteers</span><span>  also  spend  weekends  with  city  fami</span></p> <p><span>  lies.</span></p> <p><span>  “You  get  to  know  a  country  and</span><span>  the  people  get  to  know  you  and</span><span>  maybe  after  that  they’ll  think  a  little</span><span>  differently,”  says  volunteer  Bern</span><span>  hard  Rohrbacher,  20,  from  Bonn.</span><span>  That’s  the  sigh  of  reconciliation',</span><span>  adds  Dahm.  “It’s  small  steps  and</span></p> <p><span>  hard  work.”</span></p> "

He  .chose  exile</span><span>  in  Paris,  married  a  simple  unedu</span><span>  cated  country  girl,  and  lived</span><span>  there  the  rest  of  his  life.

The  Power  of  Men  is  the  Patience  of</span><span>  Women  (Cristina  Perincioli)  fuses  the</span><span>  experiences  of  several  women  who  found</span><span>  their  way  to  a  Berlin  women's  refuge  to</span><span>  create  the  central  character,  Addi.</span><span>  Addi  endures  a  violent  husband  be</span><span>  cause  of  her  economic  dependence  on</span><span>  him.

Ottinger</span><span>  has  gathered  together  seven  women  repre</span><span>  senting  seven  different  female  stereotypes,</span><span>  put  them  out  to  sea  on  a  junk  and  left</span><span>  them  to  it.  Meanwhile  she  experiments</span><span>  with  a  variety  of  encounters  and  camera</span><span>  angles  which  are  supposed  to  prove  (I</span><span>  think)  that  we  are  all  trapped  by  the  past</span><span>  and  forging  a  new  society  is  going  to  be  a</span><span>  lot  more  difficult  than  Utopians  imagine.</span><span>  Most  of  the  budget  for  this  film</span><span>  appears  to  have  been  squandered  by  the</span><span>  art  department  and,  in  particular,  on</span><span>  some  wonderfully  lavish  costumes.  The</span><span>  rest  of  the  production  is  an  obscure</span><span>  celebration  of  the  amateurish  which,  had</span><span>  it  been  directed  by  a  man,  would  not</span><span>  have  rated  a  showing.</span></p> <p><span>  What,  for  me,  is  confusing  about  these</span><span>  films  is  that  they  seem  to  have  so  little</span><span>  in  common  with  the  films  of  men  like</span><span>  Herzog,  Wenders,  Fassbinder  and  Haupt</span><span>  that  have  been  shown  here  and  it  is  not</span><span>  enough  to  say  defiantly  that  women</span><span>  make  films  differently  from  men.  The</span><span>  aest-known  contemporary  German  films</span><span>  have  a  sense  of  self-assurance.  These</span><span>  films,  by  and  large,  do  not.</span><span>  People  steeped  in  the  Australian</span><span>  feminist  film  tradition  also  will  find  very</span><span>  little  in  these  films  with  which  they</span><span>  would  feel  familiar.  Australian  women's</span><span>  films  seem  to  have  a  sense  of  purpose  -</span><span>  conflicting  purpose  often  —  but  purpose</span><span>  nonetheless.</span><span>  By  contrast,  these  German  women's</span><span>  films  have  a  strong  grasp  of  the  flaws  in</span><span>  the  present,  know  exactly  what  was</span><span>  wrong  with  the  past  and  have  almost</span><span>  nothing  to  say  about  the  future.</span></p> <p><span>  Barbara  Alysen</span></p> <p><span>  Redupers</span></p> <p><span>  RONDA</span><span>  MACGREGOR</span><span>  ?</span><span>  RIM  EDITOR</span><span>  A</span><span>  PHONE  622  080</span></p> "

Some  tend  even  to</span></p> <p><span>  associate  it  with  Fascism.”</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  quite  true  that  there  has  been</span><span>  a  remarkable  (and  necessary)</span><span>  change  of  attitudes  towards  Israel</span><span>  since  1967/68  among  the  politically</span><span>  interested  young  people  in  Ger</span><span>  many,  but  it  is  incorrect  to  describe</span><span>  this  changement  in  terms  of  mere</span><span>  anti-Semitism  and  anti-Zionism.</span><span>  (Most  young  people  here  have  no</span></p> <p><span>  idea  what  Zionism  means  and  what</span></p> <p><span>  its  implications  are  for  the  Jewish</span><span>  people.)</span></p> <p><span>  The  “intricate  network  of  rela</span></p> <p><span>  tions”  now  existing  between  our  two</span><span>  countries  does  not  depend  solely  on</span><span>  the  generation  born  before  World</span><span>  War  II.

The  economic</span><span>  situation  of  the  country  is  very  oppressive.  Jobs  arc  scarce</span><span>  and  opportunities  lor  the  individual  to  distinguish  him/</span><span>  herself  rare.</span><span>  In  post-war  Germany  effort  was  required  to  develop  the</span><span>  shattered  economy  to  its  present  sophisticated  level.  But</span><span>  today  most  potential  has  been  realized.  The  economy  can</span><span>  not  really  progress  much  further  and  thus  the  future  for</span><span>  young  school-leavers  and  students  looks  fairly  grim.</span><span>  Tertiary  education  is  structured  differently  in  Germany</span><span>  if  you  are  fortunate  enough  to  secuie  a  place  at  a  tertiary</span><span>  institute  close  to  home,  you  are  faced  with  the  prospect  of</span><span>  a  heavy,  long  course  based  purely  on  lectures  (no  tutorials)</span><span>  and  in  most  cases,  the  lack  of  any  campus  life  whatsoever.</span><span>  Some  courses  are  only  assessed  at  the  completion  of</span><span>  study  and  the  rate  of  failure  is  predictably  high.  For</span><span>  example,  Law  in  Munich  is  examined  for  the  first  time  at</span><span>  the  end  of  a  five  year  course.</span><span>  A  wide  generation  gap  exists  with  the  young  resenting</span><span>  the  old  and  what  they  represent.  Since  the  war,  Germany</span><span>  has  emerged  as  a  class-conscious,  materialistic  society  and</span><span>  the  young  condemn  their  elders  for  their  narrow-minded,</span><span>  sedate  beliefs,  their  clinging  to  tradition  and  their  inability</span><span>  to  come  to  terms  with  the  behaviour  of  their  frustrated,</span><span>  lightened  children.  The  parents,  on  the  other  hand  are</span><span>  intensely  proud  ol  what  they  have  achieved  since  the  war,</span><span>  of  the  material  comforts  which  they  have  been  able  to</span><span>  provide  their  childien  with  and  are  confused  and  hurl  by</span><span>  this  criticism  and  rejection,  which  they  attribute  to  laziness</span><span>  and  lack  ol  motivation.</span><span>  Thc\\  11.1  Use  to  ,u  knowledge  the  fear  which  possesses</span><span>  mi  \\oungei  guieialmn  as  this  would  be  a  confession  that</span><span>  'hev  h.i\\e  failed  in  then  paternal  iules.</span><span>  Ina  loiwiliy  despeiale  to  assert  its  tolerance  Germans</span><span>  are  very  concious  of  their  recent  history  many  examples</span><span>  •niokianci  can  he  lound.

Young  Germans  are</span><span>  certainly  intensely  committed  to  their  beliefs.</span><span>  The  precariousness  ol  W.  Germany's  physical  situation</span><span>  also  gives  rise  .to  much  fear.  Almost  tangible  was  the  réduction</span><span>  in  tension  at  the  release  of  the  hostages  in  Teheran  and</span><span>  the  dread  th.n  the  Russians  would  move  in  to  solve  the</span><span>  ciisis  in  Poland  was  overwhelming.

If  they  do,  their  impact  through  television</span><span>  will  again  be  limited.  Already  it  seems  the  main</span><span>  channels  will  be  priced  out  of  the  Wimbledon</span><span>  market.  West  Germans,  it  seems,  are  still  not  con</span><span>  vinced  that  Becker  and  Graf  are  the  sort  of  catalyst</span><span>  Björn  Borg  was  to  a  generation  of  Swedes.</span></p> <p><span>  \"Here  in  Sweden,\"  they  observe,  \"tennis  is  avail</span><span>  able  for  all.  In  Germany  people  are  still  priced</span></p> <p><span>  out.\"</span></p> <p><span>  They  also  say  —  and  the  evidence  tends  to</span><span>  support  them  —  that  even  someone  as  talented  as</span><span>  Carl-Uwe  Steeb,  who  made  the  cup  triumph  possi</span><span>  ble  by  beating  Mats  Wilander,  prefers  the  comfort</span><span>  of  the  Bundesliga,  where  sponsorship  can  bring</span><span>  lucrative  rewards,  to  the  competitive  demands  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  circuit.</span></p> <p><span>  League  tennis,  which  extends  the  clay-court  sea</span><span>  son,  has  been  the  bane  of  a  succession  of  West</span><span>  German  national  coaches.  A  decade  ago  Rolf</span><span>  Gehring  and  Uli  Pinner  were  among  Europe's  best,</span><span>  but  they  never  sought  to  prove  it  on  a  world-wide</span></p> <p><span>  stage.</span></p> <p><span>  In  Becker  and  Graf,  though,  their  nation  has</span><span>  been  blessed  with  two  superstars  possessing  an</span><span>  insatiable  appetite  for  success.  Becker  says  he  is</span><span>  ready  to  lift  his  game  to  a  new  level.</span></p> <p><span>  \"Now  I  have  a  pretty  good  backhand  and  a</span><span>  better  volley.  But  it's  more  that  my  approach  has</span><span>  changed.  I'm  taking  it  more  seriously  than  before.\"</span></p> <p><span>  Since  losing  to  Stefan  Edberg  in  this  year's  Wim</span><span>  bledon  final  —  his  greatest  disappointment  in  1988</span><span>  —  Becker  has  been  beaten  onlj  twice.  From  April</span><span>  to  December,  Graf  lost  just  once.  \"But  we  both  like</span><span>  winning,\"  he  grins  as  if  in  explanation.</span></p> <p><span>  Though  Becker  made  his  mark  first,  it  is  Grafs</span></p> <p><span>  influence  which  is  perhaps  more  apparent.  A  re</span><span>  cent  survey  showed  that  German  girls  arc  as  eager</span><span>  to  play  like  her  as  Americans  are  to  follow  Chris</span><span>  Evert's  example.  As  not  one  Evert  clone  has  suc</span><span>  ceeded  since  Tracy  Austin  and  Andrea  Jaeger  \"re</span><span>  tired  hurt\"  this  could  mean  that  if  Evert  and</span><span>  Martina  Navratilova  choose  to  quit  —  which  may</span><span>  well  happen  during  the  next  two  years  —  European</span><span>  domination  of  the  women's  game  will  be  almost</span><span>  complete.  Graf,  who  hits  her  ground  strokes  with</span><span>  such  ferocity,  has  little  to  fear  from  the  game's</span><span>  base-liners  and  has  shown,  increasingly,  that  the</span><span>  forecourt  holds  no  terrors  for  her.</span></p> <p><span>  Becker,  who  raised  some  eyebrows  in  New  York</span><span>  recently  by  declaring  that  clay  was  his  favourite</span><span>  surface,  has  emerged  as  a  genuine  all-court  compet</span><span>  'itor  over  the  past  year  —  and  seems  more  deter</span><span>  mined  than  ever  to  match  Gottfried  von  Cramm,</span><span>  the  only  German  ever  to  win  the  French  title.</span></p> <p><span>  Von  Cramm  won  the  French  twice,  was  run</span><span>  ner-up  three  times  at  Wimbledon  and  once  at</span><span>  Forest  Hills,  and  was  twice  US  doubles  champion</span><span>  with  Henner  Henkel.  Few  doubt  Becker  can  im</span><span>  prove  on  that.  For  Graf  a  unique  second  successive</span><span>  Grand  Slam  in  1989  is  the  immediate  goal.</span></p> <p><span>  —  Guardian</span></p> "

However,  these  new-world</span><span>  wines  which  are  named,  bottled  and/or  labelled  to</span><span>  resemble  German  wines  do  not  necessarily  have  any</span><span>  relation  to  any  emigrant  heritage.</span></p> <p><span>  These  are  often  produced  by  large  corporations</span><span>  which  have  implemented  the  recommendations  of</span><span>  marketing  research  departments  to  produce  and  pack</span><span>  age  an  imitation  of  a  quality  product  which  has</span><span>  already  achieved  public  acceptance.  Advertising  and</span><span>  promotional  campaigns  play  up  the  'German'  charac</span></p> <p><span>  ter  of  these  wines.</span></p> <p><span>  In  spite  of  their  old-world  appellations  these  'Ger</span><span>  man-style'  wines  are  usually  found  only  in  the  new</span><span>  world  countries  where  they  are  produced.</span></p> <p><span>  Another  breed  of  'German-style'  wine  has  recently</span><span>  emerged  which  is  distributed  worldwide.  Para</span><span>  doxically,  this  new  imitator  is  produced  right  at  home</span><span>  in  Germany  ...  paying  compliment  to  German  ex</span><span>  pertise,  in  vinicuitural  technology.  These  'German</span><span>  style'  wines  are  made  from  grapies  or  blends  of  wines</span><span>  from  different  EEC  countries  which  are  transported</span><span>  into  Germany  to  be  made  into  wine  or  blended,  then</span><span>  put  into  containers  (bottles,  casks  ,  or  tanks)  and</span></p> <p><span>  marketed.  Because  the  final  stage  of  production  takes</span><span>  place  in  Germany,  these  wines  may  be  labelled</span><span>  'Product  of  Germany'-—  even  though  the  wine  itself</span><span>  is  not  necessarily  of  German  origin.</span></p> <p><span>  ,  Often  these  table  wines  from  different  countries</span><span>  of  the  EEC  are  given  German-sounding  names  and</span><span>  German-looking  bottles  and  labels.  Add  to  this  the</span><span>  German  name  and  address  of  the  producer  or  bottler</span><span>  or  shipper  —  which  must  appear  on  the  label  —  and</span><span>  the  consumer  can  easily  mistake  one  of  these  'German</span><span>  style'  wines  for  an  authentic  German  wine.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  an  easy  way  to  identify  an  authentic</span><span>  German  wine:  look  for  the  wine's  official  quality</span><span>  control  number,  the  'A.P.Nr',  on  the  label.</span></p> <p><span>  A  German  wine  bearing  an  'A.P.Nr.'  offers  the</span><span>  \"consumer  the  following  guarantee.</span></p> <p><span>  The  wine  is  100  per  cent  German  in  origin  and  the</span></p> <p><span>  name  of  a  designated  wine-growing  region  within</span><span>  Germany  —  or  the  umbrella  geographical  designa</span><span>  tion  \"Liebfraumilch\"  —  must  appear  on  the  label.</span><span>  And  the  wine  has  passed  a  three-stage  test,  beginning</span></p> <p><span>  with  Government  inspections  in  the  vineyards  at</span><span>  harvest  time,  followed  by  a  laboratory  analysis  of</span><span>  the  young  wine,  arid  ending  with  a  blind  sensory</span><span>  test  conducted  by  professional  wine  tasters  at</span><span>  Government  testing  stations.  The  final  two  digits</span><span>  of  the  'A.P.Nr.'  indicate  the  year  in  which  the  wine</span><span>  passed  the  test.</span></p> <p><span>  One  reason  that  more  'German-style'  wines  are</span><span>  appearing  in  supermarkets  and  wine  shops  around  the</span><span>  world,  often  displayed  in  the  midst  of  authentic</span><span>  German  wines,  is  that  the  supply  of  German  wines</span><span>  is  limited  by  natural  factors.</span></p> <p><span>  The  weather  greatly  influences  the  quantity  of</span><span>  wine  able  to  be  produced  each  year.  At  present,  supply</span></p> <p><span>  vwine</span></p> <p><span>  is  tight  due  to  the  1980  and  1981  harvests  which,  when</span><span>  combined,  equal  slightly  more  than  one  year's  average</span><span>  production.</span></p> <p><span>  Furthermore,  the  vineyards  on  the  slopes  along  the</span><span>  Rhine  and  Mosel  are  situated  between  riverbanks  and</span><span>  forested  hillsides,  and  thus  cannot  be  expanded.  As</span><span>  demand  for  German  wine  continues  to  increase  both</span><span>  at  home  and  abroad  some  distributors  are  trying  to</span><span>  meet  the  need  with  'German-style*  wines.</span></p> <p><span>  Even  the  best  imitation  cannot  substitute  for  the</span><span>  real  thing.  Authentic  German  wine  has  a  character</span></p> <p><span>  and  tradition  of  its  own.</span></p> <p><span>  Certain  elements  which  contribute  to  the  unique</span><span>  character  of  German  wine  can,  of  course,  be  suc</span><span>  cessfully  \"relocated\"  abroad:  grape  varieties,  techno</span><span>  logical  improvements,  even  winemakers.  But  other</span><span>  factors,  such  as  the  soil  and  climatic  conditions  where</span><span>  German  wines  grow,  will  always  remain  indigenous  to</span><span>  Germany.</span></p> <p><span>  This  is  why  a  German  Riesling  wine  has  a  bouquet</span><span>  and  taste  which  is  distinct  from  that  of  an  American</span><span>  or  Australian  Riesling  wine.  The  one  is  not  necessarily</span><span>  better  or  worse  than  the  other,  they  are  by  nature</span></p> <p><span>  different.</span></p> <p><span>  And  so  it  is  with  German  wine  and  'German-style'</span><span>  wine:  no  matter  how  much  alike  they  appear,  they  are</span><span>  by  nature  different.</span></p> <p><span>  *Mr  Whyte  is  the  manager,  German  Wine</span></p> <p><span>  Information  Service,  North  Sydney.</span></p> "

By  Thomas</span><span>  Kepeally.  Hodder  &  Stoughton.</span></p> <p><span>  Thomas  Keneally’s  novel  brings</span><span>  back  memories  to  hundreds  of  Jewish</span><span>  Holocaust  survivors  of  the  man  who</span><span>  became  the  greatest  figure  in  their</span></p> <p><span>  lives,  i</span></p> <p><span>  In  Jerusalem’s  Yad  Vashem  a</span><span>  handful  of  the  elect  have  been</span><span>  honoured  by  trees  planted  in  memory</span><span>  of  “Righteous  Gentiles”  —  men  and</span><span>  women  who  risked  their  lives  to  save</span><span>  those  of  Jews  in  the  black  days  of  Nazi</span><span>  persecution.  High  among  these  is  the</span><span>  name  of  Oskar  Schindler,  a  Sudeten</span><span>  Gentian  who  against  all  SS  pressure</span><span>  insisted  on  employing  Jews  in  his  war</span><span>  time  factories  near  Cracow  in  Poland,</span><span>  Jews  who  were  never  beaten  or  killed</span><span>  and  whom  he  treated  with  respect  and</span><span>  even  affection  —  those  with  whom  he</span><span>  had  most  contact  were  referred  to  as</span><span>  “Schindler’s  Children”  and  many  of</span><span>  them  remained  in  close  contact  with</span><span>  him  up  to  the  time  of  his  death,  in</span><span>  October  1974.  At  a  rough  estimate  he</span><span>  helped  to  save  the  lives  of  about  1200</span><span>  Jews.</span></p> <p><span>  This  he  did  not  only  by  treating</span><span>  them  well  and  feeding  them  in  a  way</span><span>  which  would  have  been  deemed</span><span>  lucullan  by  the  inmates  of</span><span>  concentration-camps,  but  by  using  his</span><span>  personal  good  relations  with  the  SS  to</span><span>  prevent  their  deportation  to  such</span><span>  places  of  horror.  When  some  of  the</span><span>  women  from  his  Brinnlitz  factory  were</span><span>  removed  to  Auschwitz,  he  followed</span><span>  them  there  and  argued  stoutly  and</span><span>  stubbornly  for  their  return  to  his  care.</span><span>  His  case  was  that  they  were  all  skilled</span><span>  workers  —  his  factories  produced</span><span>  mainly  enamel  ware  but  munitions  too</span><span>  —  and  that  their  departure  had</span><span>  disrupted  production.  Keneally  tells</span><span>  the  almost  unbelievable  story  how</span><span>  Schindler  won  his  case,  and  how  the</span><span>  SS  authorities  at  Auschwitz,  even</span><span>  while  busy  with  their  extermination,</span><span>  returned  all  “his  Jews”  to  him,  and  to</span><span>  safety.</span></p> <p><span>  This  was  a  typical  instance  of  Oskar</span><span>  Schindler’s  “chutzpa.”  He  was  no</span><span>  intellectual.  He  was,  intriguingly,  a</span><span>  man  of  few  principles;  he  drank  a  great</span><span>  deal,  he  was  habitually  unfaithful  to</span><span>  his  wife  and  unashamedly</span><span>  promiscuous,  he  had  not  the  slightest</span><span>  hesitation  in  using  the  black  market</span><span>  and  bribing  whenever  expedient  —  to</span><span>  gain  the  concession  of  safeguarding</span><span>  ‘‘his  Jews”  from  the  SS,  he  used  an</span><span>  interesting  admixture  of  .diamonds,</span><span>  alcohol  and  ham.  But  he  had  what  the</span><span>  Nazis  would  have  considered  a</span><span>  shocking  “weakness”  —  for  Jews.  By</span><span>  presenting  the  story  as  a  novel,</span><span>  Keneally  tries  to  show  how  something</span><span>  ,deep  within  Schindler,  some</span><span>  unexplained  instinct,  prompted  his</span><span>  determination  to  succour  and  defend</span><span>  the  Jews  in  his  care.</span></p> <p><span>  He  met  no  heroic  end,  dying  of</span><span>  hardening  of  the  arteries  which  may</span><span>  well  have  been  brought  on  by  his</span><span>  drinking  habits.  He  was  none  the  less  a</span><span>  “Righteous  Gentile”  for  all  that  —  if</span><span>  only  because,  with  the  end  of  the  war</span><span>  in  sight,  he  made  a  birthday-speech</span><span>  in  front  of  members  of  the  dreaded  SS,</span></p> <p><span>  promising  that  he  would  stick  the  war  \\</span></p> <p><span>  out  until  “his  Jews”  were  safe  and  i</span><span>  free.  He  was  37,  and  risking  the  whole</span></p> <p><span>  second  half  of  his  life.  His  life,  both  l</span><span>  before  and  after  the  war,  was  that  of  a</span></p> <p><span>  drinker  and  businessman  and  totally  /  j</span></p> <p><span>  unmemorable  and  after  the  war  he  had  i</span><span>  to  be  helped  repeatedly  by  survivors</span></p> <p><span>  among  “his  Jews.”  Yet  he  was  one  of  j</span></p> <p><span>  that  small  band  of  Germans  who  ?</span><span>  needed  a  recognisable  challenge  to  his</span><span>  true  morality,  and  who  rose  to  the</span><span>  occasion.</span></p> <p><span>  Keneally’s  novel  has  just  won  the  !</span><span>  Booker  Prize,  Britain’s  premier  i</span><span>  literary  award,  and  deservedly  so.</span><span>  After  talking  to  many  surviving</span></p> <p><span>  “Schindler  Jews”  about  their  ]</span><span>  memories,  he  has  presented  his  story  j</span><span>  as  “faction”  —  a  detailed,</span></p> <p><span>  documented  true  story  presented  and  .  *</span><span>  built  up  as  fiction  —  but  he  draws  a  *</span><span>  convincing  picture  which  lingers  in  the  1</span><span>  mind  of  the  total  Jewish  nightmare  of  1</span><span>  the  Holocaust  and  of  one  ordinary  |</span></p> <p><span>  German’s  stand  against  it.</span></p> "

That  would  likely  make</span><span>  Schwammberger  the  first  alleged</span><span>  Nazi  war  criminal  to  be  tried  in  a</span><span>  unified  Germany.

He  escaped,  probably  in  1948,</span><span>  to  Argentina  with  what  is  believed</span><span>  to  have  been  help  from  Odessa,  a</span><span>  Nazi  fugitive  network.

Forty-six  of</span><span>  these  poets  also  figure  in  Page's</span><span>  Guide,  and  there  is  more  than  coinci-</span><span>  dental,  at  times  verbal,  similarity  be-</span><span>  tween  Page's  lengthy  introduction  to</span><span>  contemporary  Australian  poetry  and</span><span>  Volker  Wolfs  German  introduction</span><span>  to  the  bilingual  anthology.  Who  is</span><span>  echoing  whom  is  not  for  me  to  spec-</span></p> <p><span>  ulate.</span></p> <p><span>  Wolf  is  one  of  the  group  of  transla-</span><span>  tors  which  also  includes  the  two  edi-</span><span>  tors,  charged  with  the  gargantuan</span><span>  task  of  rendering  into  German  verse</span><span>  the  enormous  variety  of  language</span><span>  and  styles  represented  in  poems  as</span><span>  diverse  as  Les  Murray's  \"The  people</span><span>  are  eating  dinner  in  that  country</span><span>  north  of  Legge's  Lake\"  and  Ania</span><span>  Walwicz's  performance  poems  (i.e.</span><span>  poetic  prose  pieces)  \"Australia\"  and</span></p> <p><span>  \"The  Tattoo\".</span></p> <p><span>  Inevitably,  the  translations  vary</span><span>  considerably.  Where  Australian  poets</span><span>  use  rhyme,  like  Rosemary  Dobson,</span><span>  Chris  Wallace-Crabbe,  and  Eva  John-</span><span>  son,  this  is  ignored  by  the  transla-</span><span>  tors,  and  the  distinctive  cadences  of</span></p> <p><span>  individual  poems  are  often  lost,  espe-</span><span>  cially  where  short  English  words  are</span><span>  rendered  by  lengthy  German  nouns</span><span>  or  verbs,  an  extreme  example  being</span><span>  Bruce  Dawe's  \"like  a  traffic-report</span><span>  helicopter  over  the  bankup\"  which</span><span>  becomes  the  monstrous  \"wie  ein  Ver-</span><span>  kehrsueberwachungshubschrauber</span><span>  ueber  dem  Stau\".  Jack  Davis's  rhyth-</span><span>  mic,  melodic  \"We  welcome  the  sun</span><span>  down  that  heralds  the  dark\"  explodes</span><span>  into  the  prosy  \"Wir  begruessen  den</span><span>  Sonnenuntergang,  der  die  Dunkelheit</span><span>  ankuendigt\".</span></p> <p><span>  Occasionally  one  wonders  whether</span><span>  the  translators  really  caught  the  po-</span><span>  et's  meaning.  In  Geoff  Page's  \"Small</span><span>  town  Memorials\"  the  final  four  lines</span><span>  appear  to  me  to  refer  to  the  two</span><span>  world  wars  in  reverse  order:  \"The</span><span>  next  bequeathed  us/Parks  and</span><span>  pools/But  something  in  that  first/De-</span><span>  manded  stone.\"  The  translation  turns</span><span>  both  \"next\"  and  \"first\"  into  plural</span><span>  nouns,  which  does  not  make  much</span><span>  sense.  In  Judith  Beveridge's  \"In  the</span><span>  Park\"  the  line  \"of  the  moon  adrift\"</span><span>  becomes  \"des  Mondes,  der  fei\",</span><span>  which  I  assume  is  a  misprint  for</span><span>  \"frei\".  And  are  Laurie  Duggan's</span><span>  \"Qantas  Bags\"  really  \"Tueten\"  in</span><span>  German,  a  word  which  connotes  ice</span><span>  cream  cones  and  even  breathalyzers</span><span>  rather  than  cabbin  baggage?</span></p> <p><span>  Admittedly,  these  are  trifling  cav-</span><span>  ils  in  a  book  well  furnished  with</span><span>  good  German  translations,  and  they</span></p> <p><span>  are  unlikely  to  detract  from  the  en-</span><span>  joyment  which  Austrian  or  German</span><span>  or  Swiss  readers  will  derive  from  the</span><span>  poems  in  this  excellent  anthology.</span><span>  Moreover,  considering  the  steady  in-</span><span>  flux  of  English  words  into  contempo-</span><span>  rary  German,  of  which  visitors  to</span><span>  German-speaking  countries  or  view-</span><span>  ers  of  Derrick  must  be  very  con-</span><span>  scious,  it  seems  quite  proper  that</span><span>  Jennifer  Strauss's  \"sand  and  sex\"</span><span>  should  appear  as  \"Sand  und  Sex\"  or</span><span>  that  Robert  Harris's  \"junkies\"  should</span><span>  appear  as  \"die  Junkies\"  in  Rudi</span><span>  Krausmann's  translation.  Even  the</span><span>  retention  of  \"possum\"  in  the  German</span><span>  text  of  some  poems  seems  appropri-</span><span>  ate,  although  in  another  poem  the</span><span>  word  is  rendered  by  the  German</span></p> <p><span>  word  \"Beutelratten\".</span></p> <p><span>  Most  of  the  translations  do  justice</span><span>  to  the  original  Australian  poems.  In</span><span>  a  few  instances  they  seem  almost  an</span><span>  improvement  on  the  originals,  which</span><span>  is  not  unknown  in  the  history  of  po-</span><span>  etic  translations.  Nancy  Cato's  \"The</span><span>  Dead  Swagman\"  reads  very  well  in</span><span>  the  German  version,  where  the  pen</span><span>  ultimate  line  \"die  Wurzeln  und  Kno-</span><span>  chen  beruehren  sich  auf  dem  Boden\"</span><span>  suggests  an  even  closer  intimacy  of</span><span>  the  dead  man  and  the  tree  than  the</span><span>  original.  Other  renderings  which</span><span>  have  struck  me  as  particularly  felici-</span><span>  tous  are  Krausmann's  translations  of</span><span>  Kate  Llewellyn's  \"Finished\"  and  the</span><span>  German  version  by  Krausmann  and</span><span>  Gerald  Ganglbauer  of  Richard  Tip-</span><span>  ping's  \"Mangoes\".  The  German  writ-</span><span>  er  Hans  Magnus  Enzensberger  trans-</span><span>  lated  (except  for  one  stanza)  the</span><span>  longest  poem  in  the  book,  John  Tran-</span><span>  ter's  \"The  False  Atlas\";  it  is  a  re-</span><span>  markably  close  yet  wholly  idiomatic</span><span>  German  rendering.</span></p> <p><span>  As  Gisela  Triesch  points  out  in</span><span>  her  postscript,  almost  half  the  poets</span><span>  here  represented  are  women,  and</span></p> <p><span>  there  is  a  fair  selection  of  Aboriginal</span><span>  and  ethnic  writers.  They  all  rightly</span><span>  belong  in  an  anthology  of  \"Austra-</span><span>  lian  Poetry  Today\",  and  the  themes</span><span>  which  many  of  their  poems  address,</span><span>  like  Eva  Johnson's  \"Right  To  Be\",</span><span>  Hyllus  Maris's  \"Spiritual  Song  of  the</span><span>  Aborigine\",  or  Marita  Kefala's  \"They</span><span>  Are  Still  Coming\",  continue  to  be</span><span>  highly  topical  in  Australia  today.</span></p> <p><span>  The  arrangement  of  the  poets  in</span><span>  Made  in  Australia  is  by  date  of  birth,</span><span>  beginning  with  Margaret  \"Diesendorf,</span><span>  who  was  born  in  1912  and  died  two</span><span>  years  ago,  and  leading  up  to  poets</span><span>  born  in  1960.  Obviously,  editorial</span><span>  preference  and  available  space  deter-</span><span>  mined  inclusions  and  omissions,  but</span><span>  few  readers  will  dispute  that  it  is  a</span><span>  well-balanced,  carefully  selected  an-</span><span>  thology.  The  inclusion,  as  the  last</span><span>  poem,  of  Maureen  Watson's  \"Step-</span><span>  ping  Out\"  with  its  final  \"I  don't</span><span>  walk,  I  strut,/\"Cause  now,  I'm  liber-</span><span>  ated\"  provides  a  very  moving  end-</span><span>  ing.

Perhaps  not  mischief  —  rather,</span><span>  some  appallingly  bad  history.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  “simply  wrong\",  he  declares,  to  say</span><span>  “that  Germany  was  pervasively  antisemitic</span><span>  before  Hitler  came  to  power”.  There  was  a</span><span>  “golden  age  of  Jewish  achievement”,  typi</span><span>  fied  by  Berlin  giving  Einstein  “a  princely</span><span>  official  residence”  in  1930.  Jews,  he  con</span><span>  tends,  were  “universally  accepted  in</span><span>  Weimar  Germany”;  most  had  good,  “even</span><span>  excellent  relations  with  their  Gentile  neigh</span><span>  bours  until  1938”  —  in  fact,  he  writes,  most</span><span>  didn’t  perceive  Germany  as  “murderously</span><span>  anti-Jewish  even  after  1933”  and  “most  Ger</span><span>  mans  remained  where  they  were  until  after</span><span>  Kristallnacht”.</span></p> <p><span>  In  so  saying,  Rubinstein  deplores  the</span><span>  “ahistoricity  which  bedevils  so  many  works</span></p> <p><span>  on  the  Holocaust\".</span></p> <p><span>  My  concern  is  with  his  unhistoriCity.</span><span>  What  can  and  should  be  said  about  the</span><span>  position  of  German  Jews  from  the  end  of</span><span>  the  19th  century  until  1933  in  the  cultural,</span><span>  political,  academic,  scientific,  social  and</span><span>  even  sporting  fields?</span></p> <p><span>  Modern  German  antisemitism  began  with</span><span>  the  peasant  riots  of  1819.  And  while  there</span><span>  are  different  antisemitisms,  much  of  the</span><span>  content  forms  a  continuity.  From  the  mid</span><span>  dle  of  the  last  century,  the  Jew  was  depict</span><span>  ed  in  literature  as  being  without  soul,  with</span><span>  out  the  traditional  humble  German  virtues,</span><span>  uprooted,  troublesome,  malevolent,  shift</span><span>  less.  Much  of  the  literature  followed  Gus</span><span>  tav  Freytag’s  character  Veitel  Itzig,  who  was</span><span>  ugly,  grasping,  without  a  shred  of  humani</span><span>  ty.  Hermann  Godsche’s  novels  revealed  the</span><span>  Jews  as  conspirators  against  the  Gentile</span></p> <p><span>  world.</span></p> <p><span>  Wilhelm  Marr,  who  coined  the  word</span><span>  “Antisemitism”  and  founded  the  Antisemite</span><span>  League  in  1879,  placed  much  store  in  these</span><span>  literary  pieces.  His  “Semitism”  was  invent</span><span>  ed  to  distinguish  between  German  and  Jew,</span><span>  not  between  Christian  and  Jew.  Through</span><span>  his  works  and  those  of  Eugen  Duhring  and</span><span>  Heinrich  von  Treitschke,  the  stereotype  of</span><span>  the  dangerous  Jew  was  integrated  into  the</span><span>  dynamics  of  the  Volkisch  struggle  against  a</span><span>  state  that  didn’t  represent,  for  them,  the</span><span>  true  will  of  the  German  Volk.</span></p> <p><span>  As  early  as  1895,  Hermann  Ahlwardt</span><span>  introduced  a  Reichstag  Bill  to  close  Ger</span><span>  many’s  borders  to  “Israelites  who  are  not</span><span>  citizens  of  the  Reich”.  Teutons  wanted  no</span><span>  more  Jews,  people  of  a  different  race  and</span><span>  culture,  people  who  would,  as  cholera  bacil</span><span>  li,  cause  the  death  of  Germans.  Mixing  the</span><span>  metaphor,  he  saw  them  as  beasts  of  prey</span><span>  who  had  best  be  exterminated.  But  tramps,</span><span>  beggars  and  social  nuisances  were  differ</span><span>  ent:  they  were  “Germans  like  us\"  —  some</span><span>  thing  the  Jew  could  never  be.  The  Bill  was</span><span>  defeated  by  167  to  51  in  favour  —  but  suc</span><span>  ceeded  in  1906.</span></p> <p><span>  The  German  rather  than  the  Nazi  state</span><span>  had  a  view  of  the  Jews  as  a  biologically</span><span>  determined  race.  Frenchman  Comte  Arthur</span><span>  de  Gobineau’s  works  on  “the  essential</span><span>  inequality  of  the  human  races”  postulated</span><span>  that  mixed  and  mongrel  man  had  finally</span><span>  come  together  in  a  “pure  blood  type”  and</span><span>  that  Jews,  as  “baneful  germ  plasms”,  were</span><span>  the  omnipresent  danger  to  that  purity.  De</span><span>  Gobineau  societies  spread  throughout  Ger</span><span>  many,  aided  by  Wagner  and  his  son-in-law,</span><span>  Houston  Stewart  Chamberlain.  They  spear</span><span>  headed  an  antisemitism  which,  while  not</span><span>  yet  physically  murderous,  was  homicidal  in</span><span>  language,  spirit  and  intent.  From  then  on,</span><span>  journals  and  university  departments  of</span><span>  “racial  hygiene”  flourished  —  well  before</span><span>  Hitler.  Volkisch  belief,  now  substantiated</span><span>  by  “science”,  owed  nothing  to  Hitler,  but</span><span>  much  to  Imperial  and  Weimar  Germany.</span></p> <p><span>  Legally,  Jews  received  little  justice  and</span><span>  almost  no  satisfaction  from  the  Weimar</span><span>  courts.  The  Centralverein  fur  deutsche</span><span>  Staatsburger  judischen  Glaubens,  founded  in</span><span>  1893,  spent  decades  fighting  attacks,  calum</span><span>  nies  and  libels  on  Jews,  using  Paragraph</span><span>  130  of  the  Criminal  Code  (on  incitement  to</span><span>  racial  violence)  and  then,  in  despair  at  the</span><span>  courts  finding  any  favour  for  Jews,  using</span><span>  Paragraph  166  on  crimes  against  religion.</span></p> <p><span>  The  chief  defamer  was,  of  course,  Julius</span><span>  Streicher  and  his  Der  Sturmer.  In  the  “Great</span></p> <p><span>  24</span></p> <p><span>  Nuremberg  Ritual  Murder  Trial”  of  1929,</span><span>  Streicher  was  charged  with  suggesting  that</span><span>  some  unsolved  deaths  were  Jewish  ritual</span><span>  murders.  He  was  given  two  months  in</span><span>  prison,  but  nearly  every  other  case  brought</span><span>  against  him  resulted  in  acquittal  because</span><span>  he  argued,  successfully,  that  he  was  never</span><span>  attacking  the  Jewish  religion,  but  the  sepa</span></p> <p><span>  rate  Jewish  race!</span></p> <p><span>  In  1924  a  judge  came  to  the  aid  of  a  news</span><span>  paper  editor  charged  with  incitement</span><span>  against  Jews.  This  was  “far  from  incite</span><span>  ment”,  he  ruled:  “even  the  best  men  of  our</span></p> <p><span>  An  illustration  from  one  ot  Julius  Streicher’s  antisemitic  children’s  books  depicts  blond  German  children  rejoicing  as  grossly  caricatured  Jewish</span><span>  chddren  are  expelled  from  school.  Sbartav  oflhe  Dictators,  Time  Life  Books</span></p> <p><span>  nation  share  this  view”  (of  Jews).  A  Berlin</span><span>  court  rejected  a  Jewish  landlord’s  claim  of</span><span>  defamation  against  an  evicted  foreign  ten</span><span>  ant  who  called  him  “a  German  swine”.  The</span><span>  startling  judgment  was  that  “despite  his</span><span>  German  citizenship,  the  plaintiff  does  not</span><span>  fall  into  the  category  of  persons  popularly</span><span>  connoted  by  the  word  ‘German’.”  Und  so</span><span>  weiter'm  the  pre-Hitlerian  courts.</span></p> <p><span>  The  German  Youth  Movement,  the  Wan</span><span>  denogel,  was  based  on  the  concept  of  Volk</span><span>  —  that  is,  German  faith,  heroism,  tradition,</span><span>  lore  and  all  the  Nordic  virtues.  By  1914,  92</span><span>  percentre  of  the  local  chapters  reported</span><span>  they  had  no  Jewish  members;  in  fact,  84</span><span>  percent  had  specific  constitutional  clauses</span><span>  banning  Jews.  Blau  Weiss,  the  Blue  and</span><span>  White  Jewish  Youth  Movement,  was  found</span><span>  ed  in  1916  in  self-recognition  of  Jews  as  sep</span></p> <p><span>  arate  from  the  mainstream.</span></p> <p><span>  How  comfortable  could  Jews  be  in  such</span><span>  environments?  German  students  were</span><span>  swept  up  by  Volkisch  ideology,  their  frater</span><span>  nities  embracing  virulent  hostility  to  all</span><span>  things  Jewish.  The  Jews  were  “the  enemy</span><span>  within”  —  something  they  expressed  vio</span><span>  lently.</span></p> <p><span>  Die  Mitteilungsblatter,  the  major  Jewish</span><span>  journal  devoted  to  combatting  anti</span><span>  semitism,  had  much  to  report.  Thus,  when</span><span>  a  distinguished  legal  professor  told  his</span><span>  class  to  read  the  works  of  two  Jewish  legal</span><span>  theorists,  he  was  jeered  and  decried.  In</span><span>  1920  Berlin  University  students  threatened</span><span>  to  riot  if  the  university  went  ahead  with  a</span><span>  memorial  service  for  the  assassinated  For</span><span>  eign  Minister,  the  Jewish  Walter  Rathenau.</span></p> <p><span>  As  ever,  the  only  protection  for  Jews  was</span><span>  to  form  their  own  fraternities,  starting  as</span><span>  early  as  1896.  As  ever,  they  were  ostracised</span></p> <p><span>  by  university  authorities  and  closed  (down</span><span>  at  every  opportunity.  Heidelberg  University</span><span>  decreed  that  “the  very  existence  of  a  Jew</span><span>  ish  fraternity  is  sufficient  to  endanger</span><span>  peace  amongst  the  students”.</span></p> <p><span>  The  highest  form  of  social  interaction</span></p> <p><span>  among  students  was  duelling,  for</span><span>  sport  and  for  honour.  Early  on,  Ger</span><span>  man  students  barred  Jews  from  this  signifi</span><span>  cant  activity.  Smash  the  Jewish  conspiracy</span><span>  and  the  Volk  will  flourish  —  that  was  the</span><span>  message  from  noisy  students  and  very</span><span>  silent,  very  acquiescent  professors.</span></p> <p><span>  Jews  were  excluded  from  the  socially</span><span>  important  gymnastic  organisations.  As</span><span>  always,  they  had  to  form  their  own  Tumer</span><span>  schaften.  Gershom  Scholem  has  written</span><span>  poignantly  about  the  assimilating,  German</span><span>  loving,  German-craving  Jews.  The  German</span><span>  liberals  asked:  what  kind  of  civilisation  or</span><span>  religion  or  culture  or  “race”  is  this  that  sur</span><span>  renders  itself  in  this  way?  And  the  Jew</span><span>  haters  asked:  what  kind  of  fifth  column,</span><span>  what  kind  of  bacillus,  is  this  that  invades</span><span>  us,  that  purports  to  be  “us”  when  it  so</span><span>  patently  isn’t,  and  can’t  be?  Crushed  by  this</span><span>  dilemma,  German  Jewish  male  youth  resort</span><span>  ed  to  suicide  in  cosmic  numbers  between</span><span>  the  wars.  Suicide  a  litmus  of  “excellent  rela</span><span>  tions”  within  Germany?</span></p> <p><span>  Einstein,  his  “princely  official  residence\"</span><span>  notwithstanding,  was  hated  by  many.  As</span><span>  one  Nobel  Laureate  observed:  “A  Jew  con</span><span>  spicuously  lacks  understanding  for  the</span><span>  truth,  in  contrast  to  the  Aryan  research  sci</span></p> <p><span>  entist.”</span></p> <p><span>  Rubinstein’s  “golden  age”  of  achievement</span><span>  really  began  with  the  creation,  in  Septem</span><span>  ber  1933,  of  the  first  (and  only)  Jewish  roof</span><span>  body,  the  Reichsuertretung  der  Deutschen</span><span>  Juden,  under  Rabbi  Leo  Baeck.  Under  the</span><span>  direction  of  Martin  Buber,  Jewish  adult  edu</span><span>  cation  programs  led  to  Schocken  Books</span><span>  publishing  5000  tiles  between  1933  and</span><span>  1938.  A  great  achievement  —  but  how</span><span>  “golden\"  were  the  dynamics  that  gave  rise</span></p> <p><span>  to  it?</span></p> <p><span>  So  what  did  the  majority  of  German  Jews</span><span>  perceive  about  their  world?  How  comfort</span></p> <p><span>  able  were  they  in  a  society  in  which  they</span><span>  believed  they  were  integrated  and  accept</span><span>  ed,  in  which  they  pursued  German-ness</span><span>  rather  than  Jewishness,  but  which  degrad</span></p> <p><span>  ed  them  in  special  laws,  denied  them  judi</span><span>  cial  fairness,  excluded  them  from  the  social</span><span>  and  sporting  life  of  universities,  despised</span><span>  them  in  mainstream  literature,  excoriated</span><span>  them  as  racially  different  —  and  danger</span></p> <p><span>  ous?</span></p> <p><span>  What  they  did,  Professor  Rubinstein,  was</span><span>  leave,  in  great  numbers.  To  the  best  of  any</span><span>  one’s  knowledge,  there  were  566,602  Jews</span><span>  in  Germany  in  1933  —1  a  mere  0.86  percent</span><span>  of  the  population.  By  1941,  347,103,  or  60</span><span>  percent,,  had  left.  More,  significant  is  that</span><span>  252,400,  or  just  on  45  percent,  had  left</span></p> <p><span>  before  Kristallnacht,  and  before  the  forced</span><span>  emigration  policy  got  fully  under  way.</span></p> <p><span>  The  years  tell  their  own  story:  63,400  left</span><span>  in  1933,  mainly  due  to  the  “de-Judaising\"  of</span><span>  the  public  service;  45,000  emigrated  in  1934</span><span>  because  of  panic,  uncertainly,  alarm  at  the</span><span>  desecration  of  shules  and  the  increase  in</span><span>  arbitrary  arrests.  Enough  Jews  thought</span><span>  1935  “a  good  year”  —  the  year  the  Nurem</span><span>  berg  Laws  made  them  non-citizens;  the  feel</span><span>  ing  was  that  they  could  accommodate  to</span><span>  this  if  this  was  the  worst  that  was  to  be.</span><span>  “Let’s  wait  another  winter,”  they  ratio</span><span>  nalised,  even  though  the  optimists  knew</span><span>  there  could  be  no  return  to  early  Weimar.</span><span>  Only  35,000  left.  The  following  year  was</span><span>  also  a  “good”  one,  the  Olympic  year,  when</span><span>  34,000  emigrated.  1937  was  the  best  year</span><span>  yet;  there  appeared  to  be  an  “accommoda</span><span>  tion”  of  sorts  and  the  number  of  Jews  in</span><span>  concentration  camps  was  low  —  only  7000!</span><span>  The  following  year,  in  the  10  months  before</span><span>  November  9,49,000  Jews  left.</span></p> <p><span>  Hitler  didn  t  arrive  with  an  X-File  package</span><span>  called  antisemitism.  There  were  two  (or</span><span>  more)  antisemitisms  in  Germany  and  it  cer</span><span>  tainly  was  Hitler  who  radicalised  the  tradi</span><span>  tional  form  of  it.  Rubinstein  asserts  that</span><span>  Jews  were  comfortable  with  the  Weimar</span><span>  brand  and  “enjoyed  excellent  relations”</span><span>  with  their  despisers  and  detractors.  If  that</span><span>  is  true,  then  it  tells  us  something  about</span><span>  some  German  Jews  and  their  perceptions,</span><span>  or  absence  of  them.  To  say  that  they  were</span><span>  happy  is  not  to  say  that  there  was  no</span><span>  objectively  visible  and  provable  danger</span><span>  intrinsic  to  their  past  and  their  present.</span></p> <p><span>  Colin  Tatz  is  Professor  of  Politics  at  Mac</span><span>  quarie  University  and  director  of  Macquarie’s</span><span>  Comparative  Genocide  Studies  Centre.</span></p> "

The  Stuttgart  court  found</span><span>  him  fit  to  stand  trial.  The</span><span>  prosecutor’s  office  said  the  trial</span><span>  would  probably  begin  early  next</span><span>  year.  That  would  likely  make</span><span>  Schwammberger  the  first  alleged</span><span>  Nazi  war  criminal  to  be  tried  in  a</span><span>  unified  Germany.

He  escaped,  probably  in  1948,</span><span>  to  Argentina  with  what  is  believed</span><span>  to  have  been  help  from  Odessa,  a</span><span>  Nazi  fugitive  network.  Before</span><span>  escaping  detention  in  1945,</span><span>  Schwammberger,  an  Austrian  by</span><span>  birth,  admitted  having  shot  about</span><span>  35  Jews,  according  to  the  Austrian</span><span>  police.  The  Austrian  police  files</span><span>  were  obtained  by  the  Anti</span><span>  Defamation  League  of  B’nai</span></p> <p><span>  B’rith.</span></p> <p><span>  The  indictment  in  Stuttgart</span><span>  stems  from  a  warrant  for</span><span>  Schwammberger’s  arrest  that  West</span><span>  Germany  issued  in  1972.

But</span><span>  the  notable  absence  of  a  few  Jew</span><span>  ish  leaders  sent  a  different  mes</span><span>  sage:  that  time  could  not  obliter</span><span>  ate  what  Germany  did  when  it</span><span>  was  last  a  powerful  united  coun</span><span>  try.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr  Bronfman  emphasised  the</span><span>  grip  of  history  when  he  observed</span><span>  at  the  outset  that  “there  are  many</span><span>  Jews  who  could  not  bring  them</span></p> <p><span>  selves  to  be  in  this  city  because  of</span><span>  the  anguish,  the  pain  that  Berlin</span><span>  signifies”.  He  said  he  understood</span><span>  “the  intensity  of  their  anger  and</span><span>  their  bitterness”,  but  added,  “We</span><span>  are  here  because  we  have  some</span><span>  thing  to  say  to  a  united  Ger</span><span>  many.”</span></p> <p><span>  Although  they  delivered  their</span><span>  speeches  separately,  Mr  Bronf</span><span>  man  and  Mr  Kohl  engaged  in  a</span><span>  dialogue  of  sorts.  Mr  Bronfman</span><span>  raised  several  demands  that  he</span><span>  said  the  Jewish  people  must  make</span><span>  of  a  united  Germany.</span></p> <p><span>  “The  new  Germany  must  for</span><span>  ever  teach  what  happened  [during</span><span>  the  Holocaust]  so  that  the  lowest</span><span>  point  ever  reached  in  man’s  inhu</span></p> <p><span>  manity  to  man  can  never  occur</span><span>  again,”  he  said.  The  new  Ger</span><span>  many  must  be  a  true  democracy,</span><span>  which  means  that  “all  minorities</span><span>  are  guaranteed  equal  protection</span><span>  under  the  law”,  he  said.  He  also</span><span>  said  the  German  people  “must</span><span>  always  support  Israel.  You  must</span><span>  never  help  those  who  would  help</span><span>  destroy  the  Jewish  State.”</span></p> <p><span>  Mr  Bronfman  said  Germany</span></p> <p><span>  must  never  become  a  nuclear</span><span>  power.  Nor  must  it  have  the</span><span>  means  of  perpetrating  mass  kill</span><span>  ing  or  destruction  through  bio</span><span>  logical  or  chemical  warfare.  It</span><span>  should  also  not  help  any  third</span><span>  party  attain  such  a  capability,  he</span><span>  said,  alluding  to  the  involvement</span><span>  of  West  German  firms  in  the  con</span></p> <p><span>  struction.of  a  chemical  weapons</span><span>  factory  in  Libya.</span></p> <p><span>  “Germany  must  enact  strong</span><span>  legislation  to  prevent  such  threats</span><span>  against  mankind  and  against</span><span>  Israel  and  vigilantly  enforce  that</span><span>  legislation.  Never,  never  streng</span><span>  then  the  enemies  of  Israel!”  Mr</span><span>  Bronfman  declared.  “The  path</span><span>  for  the  new  Germany  should  be</span><span>  clear,”  he  said.  “The  Jewish  peo</span><span>  ple  pray  that  you  will  prove  that</span><span>  the  world  has  nothing  to  fear,</span><span>  that  you  will  follow  the  path</span><span>  away  from  your  worst  traditions</span><span>  and  towards  the  best  traditions  of</span><span>  which  you  are  so  capable.</span></p> <p><span>  “The  great  challenge  is  to  build</span></p> <p><span>  (Continued  on  page  28)</span></p> <p><span>  GERMAN</span></p> <p><span>  (Continued  irom  page  3)</span></p> <p><span>  a  Germany  firmly  rooted  in  peace</span><span>  and  respect  for  universal  human</span><span>  values,”  he  concluded.</span></p> <p><span>  In  response,  Mr  Kohl  sketched</span><span>  his  vision  of  the  responsibilities</span><span>  of  a  united  Germany.</span></p> <p><span>  “It  remains  the  duty  of  all</span><span>  democratic  forces  to  fight  with</span><span>  out  compromise  all  those  who</span><span>  spread  antisemitic  prejudice  or</span><span>  decry  the  Jewish  religion  and</span><span>  faith,”  the  chancellor  said.  “For</span><span>  us  Germans  one  of  the  most  im</span><span>  portant  lessons  of  history  is  that  a</span><span>  democracy  must  not  put  itself  at</span><span>  the  mercy  of  its  enemies,  but</span><span>  must  actively  fight  them.”</span></p> <p><span>  With  respect  to  German  rela</span><span>  tions  with  Israel,  Mr  Kohl</span><span>  stressed  that  “close,  trustful  dia</span><span>  logue  must  remain  a  key  element</span><span>  of  the  Middle  East  policy  pursued</span><span>  by  a  united  Germany.  I  per</span><span>  sonally  guarantee  this,”  he</span><span>  added.</span></p> <p><span>  “To  us  Germans  the  right  of</span><span>  self-determination  of  nations,</span><span>  including  our  own,  is  a  particu</span><span>  larly  valuable  asset,”  Mr  Kohl  ex</span><span>  plained.  “However,  we  are  also</span><span>  aware  that  Palestinians’  right  of</span><span>  self-determination  meets  its  limits</span><span>  where  Israel’s  right  to  exist  is  con</span><span>  cerned.  A  fair  balance  must  be</span><span>  found  between  the  legitimate  in</span><span>  terests  of  both  sides,”  he  said.</span></p> <p><span>  The  chancellor  directly  ad</span><span>  dressed  the  question  of  whether</span><span>  the  Federal  Republic’s  relations</span><span>  with  Israel  and  the  way  it  has</span><span>  dealt  with  its  Nazi  past  will  be</span><span>  continued  in  the  future  by  a</span><span>  united  Germany.</span></p> <p><span>  While  he  answered  with  a  re</span><span>  sounding  affirmative,  he  admit</span><span>  ted  that  much  educational  work</span><span>  must  be  done  in  East  Germany  so</span><span>  that  the  people  there  have  a  true</span><span>  picture  of  the  terrors  and  horrors</span><span>  of  the  Nazi  past,  instead  of  the</span><span>  distorted  picture  created  by  the</span><span>  former  communist  regime.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr  Kohl  also  spoke  of  the</span><span>  dangers  of  rising  nationalism  in</span><span>  Europe.  He  cited  “the  activities</span><span>  of  the  antisemitic  [Russian]</span><span>  organisation  Pamyat  or  the  riots</span></p> <p><span>  in  Romania  against  the  Hungar</span><span>  ian  minority”  as  “proof  that  we</span><span>  in  Europe  still  have  a  number  of</span><span>  obstacles  to  overcome”.</span></p> <p><span>  The  meeting,  held  at  the  head-,</span><span>  quarters  of  the  Berlin  Jewish</span><span>  community,  was  chaired  by  Men</span><span>  del  Kaplan,  chairman  of  the  Jew</span><span>  ish  Agency  board  of  governors</span><span>  and  a  vice-president  of  the  WJC.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr  Kaplan  said  a  united  Ger</span><span>  many  “should  take  the  lead  in</span><span>  eradicating  racism  and</span><span>  antisemitism  from  the  world  and</span><span>  should  support  Israel  with  all</span><span>  your  strength,  with  its  united</span><span>  capital  the  city  of  Jerusalem”.</span></p> <p><span>  The  World  Zionist  Organisa</span><span>  tion,  which  is  a  partner  in  the</span><span>  Jewish  Agency,  decided  to  boy</span><span>  cott  the  WJC  meeting  in  Berlin.</span><span>  WZO  chairman  Simcha  Dinitz,</span><span>  who  is  also  a  WJC  vice-president,</span><span>  believes  now  is  not  the  time  for</span><span>  conciliatory  gestures  by  the  Jew</span><span>  ish  people  toward  the  German</span><span>  unification  process.</span></p> "

This  phrase  was  seized</span><span>  on  by  the  opposition  Social  Demo</span><span>  crats.  The  Finance  Minister,  Theo</span><span>  Waigel,  preferred  to  emphasise</span><span>  that  the  forecast  \"strengthens  our</span><span>  belief  in  a  positive  economic  de</span><span>  velopment\",  while  also  stressing</span><span>  the  need  for  spending  cuts.</span></p> <p><span>  The  economic  institutes  argue</span><span>  against  wages  in  the  east  being</span><span>  brought  to  parity  with  the  west  too</span><span>  quickly,  saying  the  continued  rais</span><span>  ing  of  incomes  in  the  east  \"by</span><span>  transfer  of  public  money  would</span><span>  only  weaken  the  economic  base  in</span><span>  western  Germany,  on  which  the</span><span>  upturn  of  the  east  German  econo</span><span>  my  will  depend  for  some  time  to</span></p> <p><span>  come\".</span></p> <p><span>  Similar  recent  suggestions  from</span><span>  Oskar  Lafontaine,  deputy  leader</span><span>  of  the  Social  Democrats,  have</span><span>  caused  enormous  divisions  within</span><span>  the  party,  with  sharp  protests  from</span></p> <p><span>  the  east.
